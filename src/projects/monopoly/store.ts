//      the time `paceTransition` budgets for that turn's glide / slide / hold.

//      drive the backend for one more unit — but only if `driveOp` says this
//      client may (its own / a bot's turn). Another connected human's turn
//      returns nothing, so the row can't advance past them until their client
