 *  leave bound everywhere in dev builds. State changes round-trip through the
 *  route + subscription like any other move.
 *
 *    2 / 4 / 8 — restart with that many players (fresh game from the start)
 *    0         — give every ownable square to the first player
 *    1         — randomly assign every ownable square
 *    n         — new game (restart with 4 players)
 *
 *  No-ops in production builds. */
