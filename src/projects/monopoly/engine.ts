/** Run mechanical transitions (dice, movement, rent, card draws, …) until

 *  set. No-op when the state is already at a decision point.
 *
 *  Current scope: rolls 2d6 in `pre-roll`, moves the active player, pays
 *  rent if the landed square is owned by someone else (busting the active
 *  player to the creditor when they can't cover), then either stops at
 *  `buy-decision` (unowned ownable), `game-over` (only one survivor),
 *  the next non-bankrupt player's `pre-roll` (active player just busted),
 *  another `pre-roll` for the same player (rolled doubles), or `post-roll`
 *  (default). Doubles grant another roll, capped at three in a row — the
 *  third would jail the player, which isn't built yet, so the turn just
 *  ends. Jail, card draws, and tax remain deferred. */
