/** A headless game driver: it plays a full Monopoly game in-process with no UI,
 *  driving every seat through the SAME pacer the browser uses (`driveOp`) and
 *  the SAME authoritative engine (`apply` / `autoStep`). With every seat set to
 *  a bot strategy, `driverRole` resolves to "proxy" for whoever is active, so a
 *  single in-process driver advances the whole game to its conclusion — a winner,
 *  or a safety cap if the table deadlocks.
 *
 *  This is the engine behind the `npm run sim` script (`simulate-cli.ts`): watch
 *  the bots actually play, and see how the policy behaves over a real game. Pure
 *  and deterministic — a seed fully determines the game — so it's reproducible
 *  and reusable (e.g. the win-rate tournament across many seeds in `tournament.ts`).
 *
 *  Two ways to seat the table:
 *  - `strategies` — a roster of registry `BotStrategy` names (`claude` / `dumb`),
 *    the original API the CLI uses;
 *  - `seats` — explicit per-seat `Contender`s, each a labelled `Bot`. This is the
 *    head-to-head path: it lets two *specific versions* (e.g. the v1 champion and
 *    a v2 candidate) share one table. The bots are injected per seat via the
 *    pacer's `botFor` resolver; every seat still carries a non-null `botStrategy`
 *    marker so `driverRole` proxies it exactly as a registry bot. */
