// the variance-reduction that lets the ES rank candidates on a few hundred games.

// field is the diverse RATING_PANEL, not a single opponent — so the ES optimizes
// general strength, not a counter to one bot. The frozen winner is then validated
// by the real crown gauntlet (`--panel`, both streams).
