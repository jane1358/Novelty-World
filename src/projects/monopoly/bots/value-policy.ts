// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The full-capability hybrid agent — the value-net stub grown so the model
// controls the WHOLE legal action surface, not just the reactive subset (see
// monopoly/CLAUDE.md "Bots" and the design discussion).
//
// It is `valueNetBot` (the score-candidates loop) plus one thing the loop can't
// express on its own: OPENING an intermission. Constructing a build/trade happens
// inside a `managing` / `trade-building` window, but a 1-ply lookahead on the ARM
// that opens that window sees a no-op (arming changes nothing yet), so it would
// never arm. So this layer makes the structural decision to open the window, and
// once inside, the ordinary value loop picks the best commit from the candidates
// `candidates.ts` now generates there (e.g. the develop-to-level build commits).
//
// "Open the window" is a STRUCTURAL gate (here: "is there a beneficial trade?"
// via the search, or "is a build even possible?"), not a hardcoded value judgment
// — the value function decides WHAT to trade/build (or to cancel if nothing
// helps). The pacer's per-turn-group `boundaryServed` guard means each window is
// offered at most once, so this can't loop the turn boundary. A trade window is
// preferred over a build window: completing a set is the prerequisite to
// developing it, and after a trade resolves, the same turn-group's next pre-roll
// can open a BUILD window on the freshly-completed set — trade-then-build in one
// turn.
//
// Slices wired so far: reactive decisions (via `valueNetBot`) + DEVELOPMENT (arm
// `manage` → pick the best build commit) + TRADE CONSTRUCTION (arm `trade` →
// `trade-search.ts` builds the draft → propose). Next: raise-to-buy / auction
// willingness (the deferred-payoff cluster), each adding a generator and, if it
// needs a window, an arm here.
