/** Every selectable bot policy, keyed by the seat's `botStrategy`. The pacer

 *  POINTER into the version archive (`bots/roles.ts`): `champion` is the global
 *  best by measurement, and each lineage (Claude, Jane, …) contributes a
 *  featured pointer + a derived `-latest` pointer. Crowning a champion,
 *  retargeting a featured pointer, or registering a version only moves the
 *  pointer — this file is unchanged. Keep the keys in lockstep with
 *  `BOT_STRATEGIES`/`LINEAGES` (the exhaustive `Record<BotStrategy, …>` check
 *  catches a missing one; `lineageFor` throws on an unknown id). */
