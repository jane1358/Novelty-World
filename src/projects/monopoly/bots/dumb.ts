/** The "dumb" bot policy: a note-less `BotDecision` wrapping the decision a bot
 *  `playerId` should submit right now, or null if it isn't this bot's move.
 *  Purely REACTIVE — it answers the decision phases the engine pauses on and
 *  never initiates (it doesn't build, mortgage voluntarily, or propose trades).
 *  The pacer iterates the bot seats and submits the first non-null decision; any
 *  connected client may proxy a bot (the route's version guard dedupes the
 *  redundant writes). A live human's own decisions are left to their UI — never
 *  to this policy.
 *
 *  Resolved per seat through `bots/registry.ts`. The contrast strategy is the
 *  proactive `claudeBot` (`bots/claude.ts`). Covers the proxy-driven decision
 *  phases:
 *  - `buy-decision`: buy whenever affordable, otherwise decline.
 *  - `auction`: while still in and not the standing leader, raise by
 *    `BID_INCREMENT` if the next bid stays within both the printed price and what
 *    cash covers, else drop. Bots never jam their own lead.
 *  - `must-raise-cash`: if this bot is the current debtor (whoever is in the
 *    red, possibly out of turn after a trade), mortgage the cheapest
 *    un-mortgaged, building-free property — one per call until back to ≥ 0 —
 *    then, once nothing's left to mortgage, sell off a built set's buildings.
 *  - `trade-pending`: if this bot is an un-voted party, accept (permissive — no
 *    valuation).
 *  - `jail-decision`: leave ASAP — a held Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card first (it's
 *    free), else pay the $50 fine when affordable, else `null` so the pacer
 *    issues the jail roll (gamble on doubles).
 *
 *  At `pre-roll` it returns null (no proactive arming), so the pacer simply
 *  rolls. Mechanical phases (`pre-roll` → step, `post-roll` → end-turn) are
 *  handled by the pacer itself, not here. */
