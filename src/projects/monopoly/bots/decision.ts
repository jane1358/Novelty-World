 *  explanation always lands immediately before the action it describes. The
 *  dumb baseline omits the note; the Claude policy sets it on every decision. */

/** A bot policy: given the full game state (Monopoly is open-information) and
 *  the bot's seat id, the move that seat should make right now — or `null` to
 *  accept the engine's default for this situation. One pure function covers
 *  every phase a bot is consulted in:
 *  - the reactive decision phases (`buy-decision`, `auction`, `raising-cash`,
 *    `must-raise-cash`, `trade-pending`, `jail-decision`);
 *  - `pre-roll`, where it may return a `set-queue` arm to PROACTIVELY open a
 *    build / trade intermission (its own turn or off-turn), or `null` to just
 *    roll;
 *  - `managing` / `trade-building`, where it drives the intermission it armed to
 *    a `manage` / `propose-trade` commit (or a cancel).
 *
 *  **`null` is safe and defined; so is an illegal move.** A position never
 *  requires the BOT to act — it requires the GAME to proceed, and the engine can
 *  always make a legal move on its own. A policy is therefore an ADVISOR that
 *  optionally improves on a default it can always fall back to. Whatever it
 *  returns — `null`, a wrong-phase intent, or a move the engine would reject —
 *  the pacer (`pacing.ts`, via `isLegal` + per-phase defaults) substitutes the
 *  situation's guaranteed-legal default rather than forwarding something that
 *  would stall a decision point or crash the headless sim. The default per
 *  situation: `buy-decision` → decline · `auction` → drop out · `trade-pending`
 *  → decline the vote · `jail-decision` → roll · `must-raise-cash` → the
 *  canonical value-preserving liquidation step · `pre-roll` / intermissions →
 *  roll or cancel (no proactive action). For an OFF-TURN seat that isn't the one
 *  being waited on, `null` simply means "not me" — the common, correct case,
 *  since the pacer consults every seat.
 *
 *  The upshot for an implementer: **a bot can be a BAD player but never an
 *  illegal or game-breaking one.** Return the strongest move you can compute;
 *  return `null` wherever you have no improvement on the default. Legality is the
 *  engine's job, not yours — so a strategy can be reasoned out from this contract
 *  alone, with no need to mirror the engine's validation. Termination is handled
 *  too: if you proactively arm builds / trades, you get one window of each per
 *  turn-group, so a policy that keeps proposing can never freeze a turn — you
 *  owe no guards against your own re-pitch loops.
 *
 *  The same shape works for the dumb baseline, a strong rule-based policy, and a
 *  future learned policy. See `monopoly/CLAUDE.md` "Bots".
 *
 *  Lives in its own module (not `registry.ts`) so the policies can import `move`
 *  without a cycle through the registry that imports them. */
