/** The canonical legal cash-raising step for a player who is in the red and

 *  nothing is left to mortgage, sell the cheapest built set down to bare lots.
 *  One step per call — the forced-settle loop re-checks the debt and calls again
 *  until the player is back to ≥ 0.
 *
 *  It always returns a LEGAL step while the player is genuinely in
 *  `must-raise-cash` (a debtor who can't recover even after maxing out liquidation
 *  goes straight to bankruptcy at charge time, so they never enter the phase). So
 *  it doubles as the pacer's safe default for a misbehaving bot in
 *  `must-raise-cash`, and as the `dumb` baseline's settle logic — one
 *  implementation, no drift. Returns null only if there is nothing left to raise
 *  (not expected inside the phase). */
