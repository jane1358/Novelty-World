# Evolving the Claude Bot

A long-running, multi-session initiative: make the Monopoly Claude Bot as strong
as possible through an iterative loop, not a one-shot rewrite. This doc is the
durable home for the plan, the methodology, and the honest list of things that
can go wrong — so anyone (human or Claude) can pick it up cold.

Read `bots/CLAUDE.md` first for the bot's charter and current strategy. This doc
is about the *process* of improving it.

## The core idea

A genetic algorithm, but the mutation operator is **Claude Code reasoning**, not
random perturbation. Claude studies how a game played out, forms a hypothesis
about why the winner won, and proposes a *targeted, structural* change to the
logic (not just a weight nudge). Nothing is off-limits as long as the result is
**game-legal** — the bot only ever emits `Intent`s the engine validates, so it
is structurally incapable of cheating.

Why this can beat a vanilla GA: random mutation famously stalls in **local
maxima**. Claude can deliberately accept a *short-term regression* to explore
toward a better global maximum, because it reasons about the shape of the
strategy space instead of hill-climbing blindly.

The discipline that keeps this honest: **exploration is driven by reasoning, but
selection is driven by measurement.** A hypothesis only becomes a locked-in
version when the simulator says so with statistical confidence — never because
the narrative was convincing.

**Change granularity:** prefer the *smallest coherent change* per version, so the
A/B attributes the result to one idea. But "smallest coherent" isn't always
"single line" — some improvements are synergistic (two mechanisms that are only
net-positive together; each regresses alone). When a hypothesis genuinely requires
coupled changes, that's one version — just **state the hypothesis explicitly** so
the test grades a claim, not a guess, and **bisect** the coupling if it later
regresses.

## The loop

### Near-term (manual, human-in-the-loop)

1. Claude refines the bot's logic toward a specific hypothesis.
2. Run `npm run sim` (the headless self-play harness — `simulate.ts` /
   `simulate-cli.ts`) to watch behavior and check the change does what was
   intended.
3. Review together; keep the change if it's clearly better, revert if not.
4. Repeat until the bot feels strong.

**First target:** better trading, including **N-way trades** (roadmap #1 in
`bots/CLAUDE.md`). See "Prerequisite" below — this is also what unblocks the
tournament.

### Long-term (automated A/B tournament)

Pit two logic versions against each other at scale:

- **4 bots per game: 2 on v1, 2 on the candidate v2.**
- **Randomized seats and seeds** every game, so seat order and dice luck can't
  hand either version an unfair edge.
- Run **enough games for statistical significance** (see "Measurement").
- Parallelize across **worker processes** — games are pure CPU and embarrassingly
  parallel — so a run finishes as fast as the machine allows.
- If v2 is genuinely better, **lock it in** as the new champion; then start the
  next cycle (v3 vs v2).

Keep a **versioned archive** of every bot. That lets us branch from any past
version, track progress over time, and — eventually — expose chosen versions to
human players as **difficulty levels**.

## Prerequisite: games must be decisive

The harness already surfaced the blocker: **four symmetric Claude bots never
terminate.** They buy out the board, then never trade or build (a no-trade
deadlock — see "Why the deadlock" below), so no monopolies form, no rent
escalates, and nobody goes bankrupt. A tournament can't measure a win rate if
games don't end.

So two things must hold before the automated loop is meaningful:

1. The bot must reliably *break the deadlock* — assemble monopolies and develop
   (the trading work).
2. Every game must yield a **decisive result** even if it hits the turn cap — see
   "Decisive outcome" below.

### Why the deadlock (for whoever fixes it)

Once the board is owned, `proposeBestTrade` (`trades.ts`) can't construct an
agreeable deal in 3+-handed play:

- it only considers a color where the proposer is *exactly one lot short*;
- its counterparty model correctly predicts the seller will **veto** any deal
  that hands a rival a monopoly while giving the seller none
  (`rivalMono > myMono · RIVAL_TOLERANCE`, with `myMono = 0`);
- clean *mutual-completion* 2-way swaps — the one shape that survives that veto —
  almost never exist across three opponents.

Heads-up (2 players) the mutual-completion shape is common enough that games
resolve cleanly, which is why 2-Claude and Claude-vs-dumb already produce
winners. The fix lives in trade construction: N-way deals, and/or pricing the
rival-monopoly threat (a big enough cash premium) instead of vetoing it.

### Decisive outcome (the tiebreak)

Official Monopoly tournaments don't cap *turns* — they cap *time* (typically 90
minutes), and when the clock runs out the **richest player wins**: net worth =
cash + printed price of unmortgaged property + half-price for mortgaged property +
buildings at purchase cost. There's no forced-trade or anti-stalemate rule; the
clock is the resolver.

We mirror that: a **turn cap** is our clock, and at the cap the winner is decided
by that same **official net-worth** formula — a stable, version-independent
calculation, *not* a bot's strategic `positionValue` (which is tuned for decisions,
not for fair scoring). So every game yields a winner, and a deadlock-prone version
simply tends to win "on net worth at the bell" rather than by bankrupting
opponents — a weak signal we can still measure while we drive caps toward rare.

## Measurement — making "v2 is better" trustworthy

This is a solved problem in a neighboring field: **computer-chess engine testing**
(e.g. Stockfish's "fishtest"), and we borrow it wholesale. Each version carries an
**Elo rating** earned against a **gauntlet** — the field of past champions plus
`dumb` as a floor — not just its immediate predecessor, which is what makes the
rating robust to non-transitivity. To decide whether a candidate is actually
stronger, use a **sequential test (SPRT)**: keep playing until the evidence
crosses an accept-or-reject boundary at controlled error rates, instead of fixing
a game count up front. SPRT answers "how many games?" on its own — strong changes
resolve fast, marginal ones play longer or get rejected.

On top of that, the guardrails:

- **Define the metric precisely.** With 2 v2 seats out of 4, the null hypothesis
  is a **50% win share** for "any v2 seat wins". Test the observed share against
  50% with a binomial/proportion test; report the confidence interval, not just
  the point estimate.
- **Hold out a validation seed set.** Tweak and explore on a training pool of
  seeds, but confirm an improvement on **fresh, unseen seeds** before locking it
  in — otherwise we overfit to the specific games we looked at.
- **Beware multiple comparisons.** Try enough tweaks and one will look good by
  chance. Require a real margin, and re-validate winners.
- **Evaluate against a field, not just the predecessor.** Strategy strength is
  **non-transitive** (v3 can beat v2, v2 beat v1, yet v3 lose to v1). Score a
  candidate against a *gauntlet* of past champions (plus `dumb` as a floor), so
  "champion" means generally strong, not just "exploits the last guy".
- **Mind the sample geometry.** Deterministic bots mean a given (seed, seating)
  is one fixed game; with 2+2 identical seats there are only 6 distinct seatings
  per seed, so variety comes mostly from **many seeds**.

## Coexistence & promotion

The production `claude` strategy (`registry.ts`) drives real online and dev
games. So:

- experimental versions must be able to **run side-by-side** with the champion in
  one process (the tournament needs both loaded at once);
- a candidate is only **promoted** to the production `claude` once it's validated;
- the version archive must let us reconstruct and run any past version.

How versions are represented (separate snapshot modules, a parameterized config,
or a hybrid) is an open decision — it determines how cleanly two *structurally
different* logics can coexist.

## Decisions (locked 2026-06-19)

1. **Version representation — self-contained snapshots.** Each version is a
   complete copy of the policy code (strategy + its valuation/trades), free to
   change *anything*. We do **not** pre-extract shared "bot libraries" — that would
   trap future versions into logic we may want to drop. Only genuinely stable,
   non-strategic facts (board geometry, space names, the official net-worth
   calculation) live in shared infrastructure. The live champion in `registry.ts`
   is promoted from a snapshot **only on a human green light**; the previous
   champion stays archived so we can always run and branch from it.
2. **Evaluation target — gauntlet + Elo, decided by SPRT** (see Measurement), not
   head-to-head-with-predecessor only.
3. **Decisive-outcome rule — official net-worth tiebreak at a turn cap** (see
   "Decisive outcome"). We also keep driving the bot so natural bankruptcies
   happen well before the cap.
4. **Controlled randomness is in scope.** A version may use randomness to break
   symmetric deadlocks or mix strategies — drawn from the seeded `rngState`, never
   `Math.random`, so replay stays intact. This needs a small `Bot`-contract change
   to thread the rng, made if/when a version wants it.

Still to size when we build the automated loop: the SPRT bounds (Elo0/Elo1, α/β)
and the practice vs. held-out seed split.
