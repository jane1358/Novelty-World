# Evolving the Claude Bot

A long-running, multi-session initiative: make the Monopoly Claude Bot as strong
as possible through an iterative loop, not a one-shot rewrite. This doc is the
durable home for the plan, the methodology, and the honest list of things that
can go wrong — so anyone (human or Claude) can pick it up cold.

Read `bots/CLAUDE.md` first for the bot's charter and current strategy. This doc
is about the *process* of improving it.

## The core idea

A genetic algorithm, but the mutation operator is **Claude Code reasoning**, not
random perturbation. Claude studies how a game played out, forms a hypothesis
about why the winner won, and proposes a *targeted, structural* change to the
logic (not just a weight nudge). Nothing is off-limits as long as the result is
**game-legal** — the bot only ever emits `Intent`s the engine validates, so it
is structurally incapable of cheating.

Why this can beat a vanilla GA: random mutation famously stalls in **local
maxima**. Claude can deliberately accept a *short-term regression* to explore
toward a better global maximum, because it reasons about the shape of the
strategy space instead of hill-climbing blindly.

The discipline that keeps this honest: **exploration is driven by reasoning, but
selection is driven by measurement.** A hypothesis only becomes a locked-in
version when the simulator says so with statistical confidence — never because
the narrative was convincing.

**Change granularity:** prefer the *smallest coherent change* per version, so the
A/B attributes the result to one idea. But "smallest coherent" isn't always
"single line" — some improvements are synergistic (two mechanisms that are only
net-positive together; each regresses alone). When a hypothesis genuinely requires
coupled changes, that's one version — just **state the hypothesis explicitly** so
the test grades a claim, not a guess, and **bisect** the coupling if it later
regresses.

## The loop

### Near-term (manual, human-in-the-loop)

1. Claude refines the bot's logic toward a specific hypothesis.
2. Run `npm run sim` (the headless self-play harness — `simulate.ts` /
   `simulate-cli.ts`) to watch behavior and check the change does what was
   intended — including that the BOT reasoning notes (`--log`) still accurately
   describe the new behavior, not the old.
3. Review together; keep the change if it's clearly better, revert if not.
4. Repeat until the bot feels strong.

**First target:** better trading, including **N-way trades** (roadmap #1 in
`bots/CLAUDE.md`). See "Prerequisite" below — this is also what unblocks the
tournament.

### The session handoff (one session = one version: vN → vN+1)

The loop runs **one Claude Code session per version step**. A session's job is to
produce a `v(N+1)` that **beats `vN`, proven by measurement** — not by a
convincing story. The session structure that keeps this honest and resumable:

1. **Pick up cold from the repo, not from a pasted blob.** A new session reads
   this doc, the **version log** below, and `bots/CLAUDE.md`, then *watches games*
   (`npm run sim --log`, `npm run sim:versus -- vN v(N-1)`) to see how the current
   champion actually plays. The durable state lives in the repo; the handoff
   prompt is a **pointer into it, never a payload** (a fat blob goes stale against
   the code — a pointer can't).
2. **The incoming hypothesis is a lead, not an order.** The *previous* session,
   having watched real games, carries forward **one** suggested hypothesis **with
   its evidence** (e.g. "cap rate still ~17%, concentrated on boards where nobody
   is exactly one lot short → N-way trades"), so the new session can *judge* it.
   The new session may run with that lead **or override it** with a better idea it
   sees in the sim — but if it overrides, it **records why in a sentence**, so the
   dropped lead isn't silently lost (it may still be worth a later version).
3. **One coherent change per version** (the locked granularity rule above), stated
   as an explicit hypothesis so the A/B grades a claim.
4. **Acceptance is measurement.** `v(N+1)` becomes the new **loop champion** only
   if `sim:versus v(N+1) vN` clears the bar on **fresh held-out seeds** (and,
   eventually, the gauntlet/SPRT in "Measurement"). A hypothesis that **fails to
   beat `vN` is a result, not a waste**: log it as **rejected** in the version log
   (a negative result others shouldn't re-walk) and carry a *different* lead
   forward. Never ratchet in a regression because the narrative was good.
5. **End by handing off via the clipboard.** The session closes by writing a
   short **handoff prompt** for the next one — "continue the loop, build
   `v(N+1)` from `vN`, suggested hypothesis = … because …" — **straight onto the
   clipboard** with `Set-Clipboard` (Windows), and also printing it. The human
   just opens a fresh session and pastes — no copy step, one less thing to keep
   the loop turning. (If the clipboard isn't writable, the printed block is the
   fallback copy source.)

This is the genetic loop with Claude as the mutation operator: **reasoning
proposes, measurement selects.** Bumping the loop champion needs **no human
greenlight** — see "Coexistence & promotion" for the separate, rare decision to
ship a chosen version to the live game bot.

### Long-term (automated A/B tournament)

Pit two logic versions against each other at scale:

- **4 bots per game: 2 on v1, 2 on the candidate v2.**
- **Randomized seats and seeds** every game, so seat order and dice luck can't
  hand either version an unfair edge.
- Run **enough games for statistical significance** (see "Measurement").
- Parallelize across **worker processes** — games are pure CPU and embarrassingly
  parallel — so a run finishes as fast as the machine allows.
- If v2 is genuinely better, **lock it in** as the new champion; then start the
  next cycle (v3 vs v2).

Keep a **versioned archive** of every bot. That lets us branch from any past
version, track progress over time, and — eventually — expose chosen versions to
human players as **difficulty levels**.

## Prerequisite: games must be decisive

The harness already surfaced the blocker: **four symmetric Claude bots never
terminate.** They buy out the board, then never trade or build (a no-trade
deadlock — see "Why the deadlock" below), so no monopolies form, no rent
escalates, and nobody goes bankrupt. A tournament can't measure a win rate if
games don't end.

So two things must hold before the automated loop is meaningful:

1. The bot must reliably *break the deadlock* — assemble monopolies and develop
   (the trading work).
2. Games should **end in a bankruptcy**, not time out — the turn cap is a safety
   net, and hitting it is a tracked failure, not a win. See "Winning is
   bankruptcy" below.

### Why the deadlock (for whoever fixes it)

Once the board is owned, `proposeBestTrade` (`trades.ts`) can't construct an
agreeable deal in 3+-handed play:

- it only considers a color where the proposer is *exactly one lot short*;
- its counterparty model correctly predicts the seller will **veto** any deal
  that hands a rival a monopoly while giving the seller none
  (`rivalMono > myMono · RIVAL_TOLERANCE`, with `myMono = 0`);
- clean *mutual-completion* 2-way swaps — the one shape that survives that veto —
  almost never exist across three opponents.

Heads-up (2 players) the mutual-completion shape is common enough that games
resolve cleanly, which is why 2-Claude and Claude-vs-dumb already produce
winners. The fix lives in trade construction: N-way deals, and/or pricing the
rival-monopoly threat (a big enough cash premium) instead of vetoing it.

### Winning is bankruptcy — the turn cap is only a timeout

A win means **bankrupting opponents until one player is left.** That is the only
outcome that counts as a win. We deliberately do **not** declare a winner by net
worth when a game runs long, even though official tournaments do (they cap at ~90
minutes and award the richest player). The tournament rule is wrong for *us*:

- **It would reward exactly the behavior we're trying to kill.** The trade deadlock
  that kicked off this whole initiative — bots buying out the board and sitting on
  cash — *is* a net-worth-at-the-clock strategy. If a net-worth tiebreak counted as
  a win, evolution would keep the deadlock and we'd never have pressure to fix
  trading. The metric would launder the bug into a "win".
- **Bankrupting is also what beats humans.** A bot that knows how to eliminate
  opponents crushes them; one that only stalls to a clock doesn't. The net-worth
  rule is a logistics concession to the fact that humans tire — not a statement of
  skill. Our bot should embody the skill.

So the **turn cap is a safety timeout, not a finish line.** A game that reaches it
is a **draw / no-result** — nobody wins. The cap rate is a **health metric**: a high
one means the bot is too passive (the deadlock signal), a problem to fix, not a way
to score. (If we ever expose a *timed* mode to human players, net-worth play becomes
an explicit, optional behavior for that mode — separate from the training
objective.)

## Measurement — making "v2 is better" trustworthy

This is a solved problem in a neighboring field: **computer-chess engine testing**
(e.g. Stockfish's "fishtest"), and we borrow it wholesale. Each version carries an
**Elo rating** earned against a **gauntlet** — the field of past champions plus
`dumb` as a floor — not just its immediate predecessor, which is what makes the
rating robust to non-transitivity. To decide whether a candidate is actually
stronger, use a **sequential test (SPRT)**: keep playing until the evidence
crosses an accept-or-reject boundary at controlled error rates, instead of fixing
a game count up front. SPRT answers "how many games?" on its own — strong changes
resolve fast, marginal ones play longer or get rejected.

On top of that, the guardrails:

- **Define the metric precisely.** With 2 v2 seats out of 4, the null hypothesis
  is a **50% win share** for "any v2 seat wins". Test the observed share against
  50% with a binomial/proportion test; report the confidence interval, not just
  the point estimate.
- **Capped games are draws, and a high draw rate is a red flag** — not a neutral
  outcome. Until the bot reliably *closes out* games by bankruptcy, A/B results
  stay inconclusive — which is the methodology correctly refusing to crown a
  version that can't win decisively.
- **Hold out a validation seed set.** Tweak and explore on a training pool of
  seeds, but confirm an improvement on **fresh, unseen seeds** before locking it
  in — otherwise we overfit to the specific games we looked at.
- **Beware multiple comparisons.** Try enough tweaks and one will look good by
  chance. Require a real margin, and re-validate winners.
- **Evaluate against a field, not just the predecessor.** Strategy strength is
  **non-transitive** (v3 can beat v2, v2 beat v1, yet v3 lose to v1). Score a
  candidate against a *gauntlet* of past champions (plus `dumb` as a floor), so
  "champion" means generally strong, not just "exploits the last guy".
- **Mind the sample geometry.** Deterministic bots mean a given (seed, seating)
  is one fixed game; with 2+2 identical seats there are only 6 distinct seatings
  per seed, so variety comes mostly from **many seeds**.

## Coexistence & promotion

The production `claude` strategy (`registry.ts`) drives real online and dev
games. So:

- experimental versions must be able to **run side-by-side** with the champion in
  one process (the tournament needs both loaded at once);
- a candidate is only **promoted** to the production `claude` once it's validated;
- the version archive must let us reconstruct and run any past version.

How versions are represented (separate snapshot modules, a parameterized config,
or a hybrid) is an open decision — it determines how cleanly two *structurally
different* logics can coexist.

## Decisions (locked 2026-06-19)

1. **Version representation — self-contained snapshots.** Each version is a
   complete copy of the policy code (strategy + its valuation/trades), free to
   change *anything*. We do **not** pre-extract shared "bot libraries" — that would
   trap future versions into logic we may want to drop. Only genuinely stable,
   non-strategic facts (board geometry, space names, the official net-worth
   calculation) live in shared infrastructure. The live champion in `registry.ts`
   is promoted from a snapshot **only on a human green light**; the previous
   champion stays archived so we can always run and branch from it.
2. **Evaluation target — gauntlet + Elo, decided by SPRT** (see Measurement), not
   head-to-head-with-predecessor only.
3. **Winning = bankruptcy; the turn cap is only a timeout** (see "Winning is
   bankruptcy"). A capped game is a draw/no-result, tracked as a health metric —
   *not* a net-worth win, which would reward the very stalling we're eliminating.
4. **Controlled randomness is in scope.** A version may use randomness to break
   symmetric deadlocks or mix strategies — drawn from the seeded `rngState`, never
   `Math.random`, so replay stays intact. This needs a small `Bot`-contract change
   to thread the rng, made if/when a version wants it.

Still to size when we build the automated loop: the SPRT bounds (Elo0/Elo1, α/β)
and the practice vs. held-out seed split.

## Version log

The running record of bot versions and how each fared against the field — **both
the accepted champions and the rejected attempts** (a hypothesis that didn't beat
its predecessor is logged with status `rejected` so it isn't re-walked). v1 = the
bot as of this doc.

| Version | Date | Hypothesis / change | Result vs. field | Status |
|---------|------|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| v1 | 2026-06-19 | Baseline (current `claude`) | — | champion |
| v2 | 2026-06-19 | **Price the rival-monopoly threat instead of vetoing it** (`versions/v2/trades.ts`): handing a rival a new monopoly costs the seller `DENY_FACTOR`×bonus, folded into their valuation, so "cash for the completer" clears when the cash outweighs it. | **v2 win share 69.8%** of decisive games (139–60) over 240 fresh held-out seeds, two independent families (74.0% / 66.0%), z≈5.6 vs the 50% null. Cap rate 40%→~17%; 4×v2 resolves 16/16 previously-deadlocked seeds. | **loop champion** (current best; not yet the live bot) |

## Status & next step

**Two independent tracks — don't conflate them:**

- **The loop champion** — the latest validated `vX` (currently **v2**). The
  improvement loop advances this on its own: v2 → v3 → v4 …, each branching from
  the prior best. **No human greenlight is needed to bump versions** — that's
  just Claude Code continuing to make the bot stronger.
- **The live/official bot** — `bots/claude.ts` in `registry.ts`, the one shipped
  in the game, picked by the UI, played by humans. It changes **only** on a human
  **greenlight** ("ship vX into the game"), which is a separate, deliberate, rare
  decision — *not* a precondition for continuing the loop. Today the live bot is
  still v1.

**As of 2026-06-19:** the loop has reached **v2** (the new loop champion); the
live bot is unchanged (v1). What landed:

1. **v2 isolated** in `bots/versions/v2/` (self-contained snapshot of
   `claude.ts` / `valuation.ts` / `trades.ts`; the `Bot` contract stays shared).
   `versions/index.ts` is the version archive (`v1` references the live champion
   directly, `v2`, `dumb`); `v2/trades.test.ts` pins the hypothesis.
2. **Sim generalized for head-to-head** — `simulateGame` takes per-seat
   `Contender`s and injects a per-seat `botFor`; `tournament.ts` /
   `npm run sim:versus -- v2 v1` runs the A/B (cycled seatings, win share vs the
   50% null, cap rate as a health metric). Self-play (`v1 v1`) sanity-checks ~50%.
3. **Hypothesis applied and validated** — the pricing change fires the
   cash-for-completer deal; games close out in bankruptcy (cap rate down sharply)
   and v2 wins ~70% of decisive games on held-out seeds. Pricing **alone** was
   enough — the 2-short / N-way extension was **not needed** and stays on the
   roadmap (`bots/CLAUDE.md`).

Surfaced and fixed along the way: a latent **engine** bug (shared
`development.ts`, not a policy) where a heavily-developed forced settler could be
frozen into a false bankruptcy — the hotel-shortage liquidation escape didn't
fire once a set had *partially* broken down. v2's frequent monopolies exposed it;
generalized the escape (regression test in `development.test.ts`). This is shared
rules infrastructure, so it benefits v1 and human play too.

**Next — continue the loop to v3 (no greenlight required):**

- Branch **v3 from v2** (the loop champion): snapshot `versions/v3/` from
  `versions/v2/`, apply one new hypothesis, A/B `v3` vs `v2` on fresh held-out
  seeds via `npm run sim:versus -- v3 v2`. Leading candidates from the roadmap in
  `bots/CLAUDE.md`: **N-way / 2-short trade construction** (v2 still only trades
  when someone is *exactly* one lot short) and **mortgage-to-fund** a build or
  sweetener. The eval's high *declined*-trade count (v2 offering the still-vetoing
  v1 deals it won't take) is another signal worth mining.
- Still to size when the loop goes automated (per "Measurement"): the SPRT bounds
  (Elo0/Elo1, α/β) and a wider gauntlet — the current eval is a fixed-N
  proportion test on a held-out pool, not yet SPRT/Elo.

**Independently, whenever a human greenlights shipping `vX` to the live bot:**
archive the outgoing live policy as its own snapshot first (e.g. `versions/v1/`
from the current `claude.ts` / `valuation.ts` / `trades.ts`) so it stays runnable,
then copy `versions/vX/` over the production `claude` policy and repoint
`versions/index.ts` (today its `v1` entry aliases the live `../claude`; decouple
it at that moment so `v1` keeps meaning *v1*, not "whatever now ships").
