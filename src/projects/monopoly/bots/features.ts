// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Phase 1 of the learned-bot path (see monopoly/CLAUDE.md "Bots" and the design
// discussion): a PURE, fixed-size state encoder. `encode(state, playerId)` turns
// the full open-information `GameState` into a flat `Float32Array` a model can
// consume — the input half of a learned policy / value net. Its companion is
// `candidates.ts` (the action half).
//
// Three properties make this safe to train against:
//   - PURE & DETERMINISTIC. Same (state, playerId) → same vector, always. No
//     `Math.random`, no `Date`, no engine mutation — so it slots into the
//     deterministic-replay world the engine guarantees.
//   - FIXED WIDTH. Every state encodes to exactly `FEATURE_COUNT` floats,
//     regardless of player count (absent / bankrupt seats encode as zeros).
//   - SEAT-RELATIVE. Players are rotated so the encoded seat is ALWAYS slot 0,
//     and opponents follow in seat order after it. The net therefore learns ONE
//     symmetric value function ("how good is the position of slot 0?") instead of
//     a separate one per chair — the single biggest sample-efficiency win for a
//     turn-based game with rotational symmetry.
//
// The layout is a single source of truth (`LAYOUT`): one ordered list of named
// feature specs, each a `(ctx) => number`. `encode` evaluates them in order and
// `FEATURE_NAMES` reads their names off the SAME list, so the vector and its
// labels can never drift. Add or reorder a feature in `buildLayout` and both the
// width and the names follow automatically. Heavy per-state work (seat rotation,
// net-worth, per-group tallies) is computed ONCE in `makeCtx`; the specs are
// cheap lookups into it.
//
// This is intentionally a STARTING feature set, not a final one — it captures
// cash / net worth / board position / ownership / development / set structure,
// which is enough to train a first value net. Likely enrichments later: dice /
// rent exposure ("how much do I owe if I land where?"), per-opponent set threat
// (today opponents are pooled into a single "owned by an opponent" bit per
// square plus a best-opponent fraction per group), trade-draft contents, and
// deck composition. Keep new features seat-relative and pure.
