// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The hybrid loop, wired end-to-end with a STAND-IN value function.
//
// This is the shape the learned bot will take (see monopoly/CLAUDE.md "Bots" and
// the design discussion). A `Bot` here is just:
//
//     candidates = legalCandidates(state, me)          // the action half
//     pick c maximizing  value(applyCandidate(state, c))   // 1-ply lookahead
//
// where `value` is the only learned piece. Today `value` is `heuristicValue` (a
// small hand-written position score); in Phase 2 it becomes a trained net —
// literally `V(encode(state, me))` using `features.ts` — and NOTHING else in this
// file changes. `valueNetBot(value)` is the factory that makes that swap a
// one-liner; `valueNetStubBot` is it bound to the heuristic so the loop is
// runnable now (`npm run sim -- value-stub claude-v2 claude-v2 claude-v2`).
//
// What the stub demonstrates and what it can't (on purpose):
//   - It plays the REACTIVE surface through pure lookahead: it buys (and prefers
//     set-completing buys, which the monopoly bonus rewards), votes on opponents'
//     trade proposals by comparing accept-vs-decline, settles must-raise-cash, and
//     handles jail — all by scoring the resulting state, no phase-specific rules.
//   - It ABSTAINS from proactive construction (arming a trade/build). That's the
//     Phase-2 heuristic-candidate seam (`candidates.ts` leaves those phases as
//     terminal exits only), so the stub returns `null` there and just rolls.
//   - It drops out of AUCTIONS, and never enters `raising-cash`. Both are multi-
//     step actions whose payoff (winning the lot; completing the deferred buy)
//     only materializes after several more decisions — invisible to a 1-ply
//     lookahead, which sees a placed bid as a no-op (cash isn't spent until the
//     auction resolves). A trained value net hits the same wall; the standard fix
//     is deeper search or learning the action's value directly. Noted so the
//     behavior reads as a known limit of the prototype, not a bug.
