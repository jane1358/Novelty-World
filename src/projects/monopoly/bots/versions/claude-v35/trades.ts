// ===========================================================================
// v35 SNAPSHOT — branched from champion v29. The ONLY change is the v35
// DENIAL-POSITION OPTION VALUE (`denialPositionCost`, folded into `evaluateTrade`);
// everything else is v29 VERBATIM. Exposed as `claudeV35Bot`.
//
// THE v35 FIX (the hot-potato, take 3 — and the first that should be win-SAFE):
// diagnosis showed the bot→bot ring is a PREMIUM-EXTRACTION war of attrition, not a
// real denial — the one-short rival completes its set ~86% of the time anyway,
// paying a ~$254 median premium to whoever holds the completer at cash-out. The ring
// spins because pricing is ASYMMETRIC: a buyer books the full `DENY_FACTOR` premium
// (acquisitionValue), but a HOLDER values its completer at only the printed price, so
// every hop clears at break-even — free to churn. v35 makes it SYMMETRIC: handing a
// held completer to anyone but the one-short rival forfeits the premium the holder is
// positioned to extract, so `evaluateTrade` charges that premium. Now no hop clears
// (a denier won't pay another denier the full payout for a break-even ticket), so the
// completer STAYS PUT and its holder collects the rival's premium directly — same
// cash-out, zero rotation. Unlike v33/v34 (which abstained from denial and so PAID
// premiums without COLLECTING them → −15 Elo), v35 stays in the premium game and just
// stops selling its position cheap, so it should be win-neutral-or-better. Selling TO
// the rival is the cash-out (priced by `rivalThreatCost`); distress-scaling preserves
// the protective grab off a seat about to bust. (Validated by triage vs v29.)
//
// v29's inherited mechanism (unchanged) — VERBATIM v28's trades.ts (v29's only change
// is the `DISTRESS_DISCOUNT` constant in valuation.ts). The mechanism below is v28's:
// v28 added the DESPERATION-ACQUISITION lead (lead b) as ONE coupled hypothesis
// with two halves, both expressed here + in valuation.ts:
//
//   SELLER half (`rivalThreatCost` × `distressThreatScale`): a genuinely
//   distressed seat (one deadly developed rent from bankruptcy, `cash +
//   mortgageableTotal < deadlyRent`) discounts the rival-monopoly threat premium
//   it would normally hold out for — it values immediate cash above the future
//   cost of arming a rival. This is what lets a BELOW-fair buy EXECUTE: without
//   it a v17 seat just declines and the deal washes (v24's lesson).
//
//   BUYER half (Offer D in `proposeBestTrade`): detect a distressed rival holding
//   a lot that COMPLETES one of my near-monopolies, and buy it at the discount the
//   seller will now accept — an asymmetric, proposer-side, UNDERPRICED transfer
//   (the two conditions every prior win shared: asymmetric like v5's denial,
//   underpriced unlike v24's fair-price grab). The bought lot completes MY set so
//   it is developed and held, NOT relocated — it cannot hot-potato (v14/v25).
//
// The coupling is BISECTABLE: the seller half is `distressThreatScale` (one
// multiplier in `rivalThreatCost`); the buyer half is the `owned >= 1 &&
// distressed-seller` branch in construction. Everything else is v17/v14 verbatim.
//
// THE v14 PHANTOM-DENIAL FIX it inherits (live-game Finding 1):
//
// THE BUG: v5's Offer C books the denial premium (`DENY_FACTOR×bonus`) for buying a
// rival's set-completer from a third-party holdout, gated ONLY on the rival owning
// N-1 of the set — never on whether the rival can ACTUALLY ACQUIRE the last lot. When
// the completer already sits with a non-rival (e.g. another claude bot, which prices
// `RIVAL_THREAT_FACTOR` and won't hand the rival a monopoly), the rival is ALREADY
// blocked: the marginal denial of moving the lot holdout→me is ~zero, yet each bot
// independently re-books the full premium, so a weak lot (brown: round(84×0.6)=$50,
// above the ~$30 net cost of a hop) HOT-POTATOES forever (observed: Baltic traded 29×
// in a perfect bot→bot ring, net-zero cash, zero progress). The existing guards
// (`proposedThisTurn`, `declinedWithoutImprovement`) only stop re-pitched DECLINES,
// not an accepted no-progress cycle.
//
// THE FIX (`rivalCanAcquire`): gate Offer C on the rival's ACTUAL ability to acquire
// the completer now. The rival could only get it by paying the holder's
// threat-adjusted break-even, and would only BOTHER if completing the set is
// comfortably worth that cost. For a weak set the rival's own gain barely exceeds
// (or trails) the price, so it never would — the denial is phantom; for a strong set
// the rival clearly would, so the denial is real and still fires. This also restores
// v5's STATED intent ("weak sets self-gate"), which the flat premium violated.
//
// Everything else is v5 verbatim: `evaluateTrade`, completion search, the
// counterparty model, the incoming vote, and the denial pricing for sets that DO
// pass the gate. `acquisitionValue`'s landing/auction deny is already reachability-
// gated (it only fires on an UNOWNED lot, which is open-market reachable), so it is
// untouched.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Trade reasoning. The Claude bot trades to COMPLETE monopolies — the engine of
// the mid-game — and only proposes deals it believes the other party will take.
// Both construction and acceptance run off `positionValue`: a deal is good for a
// player exactly when it raises their position value (now net of the priced
// rival-monopoly threat). Construction models the counterparty (would THEY
// accept?) and remembers declines (a "no" means the offer wasn't good enough —
// don't re-pitch the identical terms; sweeten or wait for the board to change),
// so it always terminates.
