// ===========================================================================
// v28 SNAPSHOT — fork of v17 (the champion; see EVOLUTION.md).
// v28 adds DESPERATION-PRICING to the trade engine: a distressed seller values
// incoming cash above face value (survival bonus), so construction needs less
// sweetening to clear their break-even — the buyer acquires set-completers at a
// DISCOUNT. The phantom-denial gate from v14 is carried verbatim. — fork of the champion v5's `trades.ts` (see EVOLUTION.md). v5's
// trade-to-deny construction is carried VERBATIM except ONE correctness gate that
// fixes a PHANTOM-DENIAL bug (live-game Finding 1).
//
// THE BUG: v5's Offer C books the denial premium (`DENY_FACTOR×bonus`) for buying a
// rival's set-completer from a third-party holdout, gated ONLY on the rival owning
// N-1 of the set — never on whether the rival can ACTUALLY ACQUIRE the last lot. When
// the completer already sits with a non-rival (e.g. another claude bot, which prices
// `RIVAL_THREAT_FACTOR` and won't hand the rival a monopoly), the rival is ALREADY
// blocked: the marginal denial of moving the lot holdout→me is ~zero, yet each bot
// independently re-books the full premium, so a weak lot (brown: round(84×0.6)=$50,
// above the ~$30 net cost of a hop) HOT-POTATOES forever (observed: Baltic traded 29×
// in a perfect bot→bot ring, net-zero cash, zero progress). The existing guards
// (`proposedThisTurn`, `declinedWithoutImprovement`) only stop re-pitched DECLINES,
// not an accepted no-progress cycle.
//
// THE FIX (`rivalCanAcquire`): gate Offer C on the rival's ACTUAL ability to acquire
// the completer now. The rival could only get it by paying the holder's
// threat-adjusted break-even, and would only BOTHER if completing the set is
// comfortably worth that cost. For a weak set the rival's own gain barely exceeds
// (or trails) the price, so it never would — the denial is phantom; for a strong set
// the rival clearly would, so the denial is real and still fires. This also restores
// v5's STATED intent ("weak sets self-gate"), which the flat premium violated.
//
// Everything else is v5 verbatim: `evaluateTrade`, completion search, the
// counterparty model, the incoming vote, and the denial pricing for sets that DO
// pass the gate. `acquisitionValue`'s landing/auction deny is already reachability-
// gated (it only fires on an UNOWNED lot, which is open-market reachable), so it is
// untouched.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Trade reasoning. The Claude bot trades to COMPLETE monopolies — the engine of
// the mid-game — and only proposes deals it believes the other party will take.
// Both construction and acceptance run off `positionValue`: a deal is good for a
// player exactly when it raises their position value (now net of the priced
// rival-monopoly threat). Construction models the counterparty (would THEY
// accept?) and remembers declines (a "no" means the offer wasn't good enough —
// don't re-pitch the identical terms; sweeten or wait for the board to change),
// so it always terminates.
