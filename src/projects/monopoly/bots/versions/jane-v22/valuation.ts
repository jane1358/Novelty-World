// jane-v6 SNAPSHOT — fork of jane-v2 (see EVOLUTION.md).
// jane-v6 bumps SURVIVAL_FACTOR from 0.4 to 0.6 — each dollar of cash is worth
// up to $1.60 to a distressed seller (was $1.40). The bot demands MORE when
// selling while distressed, and needs to offer LESS to acquire from distressed
// opponents. Tighter asymmetry on the core Jane mechanism. — fork of jane-v1 (see EVOLUTION.md).
// jane-v2 adds SPREAD DEVELOPMENT: two-pass planBuild that gets ALL monopolies
// to 3 houses first (the biggest rent-per-dollar jump), THEN pushes the best
// set higher. jane-v1 developed greedily one-set-to-max before the next got
// anything. More developed sets = more board coverage = more opponent landings.
// v28 adds DESPERATION-PRICING ACQUISITION via sellerDistress(): when a seller
// is financially distressed (liquid resources near or below the worst board
// rent), they value incoming cash above face value because it defers forced
// liquidation at half-price. Everything else is v17 verbatim. — fork of v14 (the phantom-denial-fixed base; see EVOLUTION.md).
// v17's one change lives HERE: it LOWERS the voluntary-spend liquidity reserve
// (`FLOOR_RENT_FRACTION` 0.5→0.3, `FLOOR_CAP` 500→300) — the untried AGGRESSIVE
// direction on the liquidity axis (v9 raised the reserve and regressed). Frees cash
// to buy/develop sooner, leaning on must-raise-cash for the rare big hit. Everything
// else is v14 verbatim (trades.ts carries v14's phantom-denial gate). Shared
// infrastructure is imported from the canonical modules — only the policy is here.
