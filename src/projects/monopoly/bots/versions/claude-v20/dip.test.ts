// v20's one change: a LOOSER buy-aggression gate (DIP_WORTH_MULT 1.4→1.15). When the
// bot can afford a lot but paying would dip below its rent reserve, it buys if the lot
// is worth ≥ DIP_WORTH_MULT × price. v17 demands 1.4× (well over face); v20 needs only
// 1.15×, so it acquires clear-value land more readily out of cash on hand.
//
// Setup: p1 owns one railroad (pos 5) and lands on a second (pos 15, price 200). The
// second rail is worth 270 (200 asset + 70 two-rail synergy) = 1.35× price — above
// v20's 1.15× bar but below v17's 1.4×. p1 holds 250 cash on a quiet board (reserve =
// BASE_FLOOR 120), so buying (250-200=50) dips below the reserve: exactly the DIP gate.
