// search-v1 — the SEARCH LAYER (a new PARADIGM for the archive).
//
// Every prior bot (claude-vN, jane-vN, gemini-vN, trade-v1) is a GREEDY 1-ply
// deterministic value-maximizer: at a decision it commits the single move that
// maximizes its hand-written `positionValue` right now. search-v1 is the first
// bot that LOOKS AHEAD. At a few high-leverage discrete decisions it performs a
// TRUNCATED-ROLLOUT search (Tesauro's TD-Gammon rollout policy improvement):
//
//   1. Enumerate a small candidate set of legal actions (the base policy's own
//      greedy choice ALWAYS included).
//   2. For each candidate, apply it, then roll the game FORWARD with ALL seats
//      (including this one at future turns) playing the BASE claude-v38 policy,
//      dice/cards sampled from a seeded RNG, for a bounded horizon of turns.
//   3. Leaf evaluation: terminal => win=1 / loss=0 for me; else my positionValue
//      SHARE among active players (a smooth [0,1] heuristic).
//   4. Average over R seeded rollout samples; pick the best-mean candidate.
//
// WHY IT'S SAFE (the trade-v1 trap avoidance): the base policy's greedy move is
// always a candidate, so rollout improvement can only MATCH or BEAT it — it never
// loses capability. A negative/EVEN result is still a clean finding.
//
// DETERMINISM (non-negotiable): all rollout randomness derives from
// `state.rngState`. Each rollout sample seeds a fresh `rngState` deterministically
// from the base state's `rngState` and the sample index (via `createRng`), so the
// played move is a pure function of state. No `Math.random`, no `Date`.
