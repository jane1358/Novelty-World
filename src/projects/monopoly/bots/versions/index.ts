// DEPRECATED in the lobby) and out of the default gauntlet field (`--with-v1`
// re-adds it for an occasional floor audit).

/** Versions deliberately LEFT OUT of the Elo ladder — the rater skips them, so
 *  they never earn a rating, and the gauntlet drops them from its default field.
 *  Both members are real, runnable snapshots kept for the archive; they're excluded
 *  purely as a COST optimization (see EVOLUTION.md Decision 8 + the gemini-v1 note):
 *    - `claude-v1` — the original champion; its trade-veto deadlock caps too many
 *      games to the turn limit (slow + least-informative).
 *    - `gemini-v1` — the weakest bot by a wide margin (~ −150 Elo below the field)
 *      AND the capped-game bottleneck, so its pairings are ~6-min slogs that swamp
 *      any ratings/gauntlet run for near-zero signal. It is the sole Gemini version,
 *      so excluding it deprecates the whole Gemini family in the lobby (intended).
 *  A version with no rating renders DEPRECATED in the lobby (struck through, "??? "
 *  Elo, disabled) — see `bots/roles.ts`. This is the lone hand-maintained
 *  rating-policy knob, and it stays tiny. `dumb` is excluded separately (it's a
 *  null stub, not a real bot). */

/** The ANCHOR PANEL — the small fixed set of opponents that BOTH the rater and the
 *  crown gauntlet measure a new version against (see `bots/CLAUDE.md` "The ANCHOR
 *  PANEL" and EVOLUTION.md). It does two jobs:
 *    - `sim:ratings` (default) fits Elo over the panel GRAPH (panel round-robin +
 *      every other version vs the panel only) instead of a full O(N²) round-robin —
 *      making a new version O(k) to rate and the archive O(N·k).
 *    - `sim:gauntlet --panel` uses it as the crown-gate FIELD: a version is crowned
 *      only if it BEATS its base AND regresses against NO panel member — so a bot that
 *      merely COUNTERS the champion (non-transitively) can't steal the crown (see
 *      EVOLUTION.md "Non-transitivity & the crown" — the jane-v3 RPS cycle).
 *  The SECOND hand-maintained eval knob alongside `RATING_EXCLUDED`; keep it small and
 *  deliberate. Membership rule: span the Elo range AND the distinct strategies, not the
 *  dense middle of washed siblings. Current roster and why each earns its slot:
 *    - claude-v2   — the rating ANCHOR (Elo≡0) + field floor + baseline rival-threat
 *                    pricing. Mandatory: it defines the scale.
 *    - claude-v5   — the denial-MAXIMIZER (active trade-to-deny, DENY 0.6, ~46 Elo).
 *                    Guards against a new bot that quietly collapses vs heavy denial.
 *    - claude-v17  — a mid-ladder calibrator (reserve/liquidity axis, ~63). Fills the
 *                    46→84 Elo gap; without it the dense 50–80 band is poorly bracketed.
 *    - claude-v35  — upper-mid + the mature symmetric denial-pricing trade engine
 *                    (`denialPositionCost`, ~84).
 *    - jane-v2     — the reduced-denial 0.3 regime, near the top (~127). Also the bot
 *                    that beats jane-v3, so it's what catches that counter at the gate.
 *    - claude-v36  — the champion: lowest-denial 0.15 regime + the ceiling, and the
 *                    crown base, so ladder and crown stay consistent (~133).
 *  Must include the rating anchor `claude-v2` and contain no `RATING_EXCLUDED` member
 *  (both asserted by the tools). When you crown a new champion, add it here (and you
 *  may retire a now-redundant member) — that keeps the ceiling of the graph current. */
