// head-to-head A/B (see EVOLUTION.md "Coexistence & promotion"). Every entry is
// a self-contained frozen SNAPSHOT — including `v1`, the original champion and
// the gauntlet's FLOOR — so a label always means that exact version. This is
// deliberately DECOUPLED from what currently ships: the live bot is a pointer
// into this archive (`bots/live.ts` → `LIVE_VERSION`), so promoting a version
// to production never silently redefines the floor. `dumb` is a null reactive
// stub — never gauntleted; v1 is the real floor of the field.
