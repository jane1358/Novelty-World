// v5's hypothesis (carried): extend trade CONSTRUCTION to TRADE-TO-DENY — block a
// rival who is one lot short of a set by buying the completer lot from a third-party
// holdout, even though it doesn't complete my own set. v3 (the base) only ever
// constructs deals that complete MY sets, so on a pure-denial board it proposes
// nothing; v5 surfaces the block. `evaluateTrade` is unchanged, so completion and
// incoming-vote behavior is identical to v3. Oranges = {16, 18, 19}; pinks =
// {11, 13, 14}; freshGame seats p1..p4.
