// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The PLAYER-FACING lobby offering — ENTIRELY DERIVED, not hand-curated. This is
// the "which bot challenges me most right now?" view, and it has exactly ONE axis:
// a bot's measured Elo IS its strength. So the whole structure (the strongest bot,
// each family's best, every version, and which are deprecated) falls out of two
// inputs:
//   - `VERSIONS` — the archive (which versions exist, by label).
//   - `BOT_RATINGS` — the GENERATED Elo ladder (`ratings.ts`, written by
//     `npm run sim:ratings`; anchored `claude-v2 = 0`).
//
// Consequences:
//   - The STRONGEST (lobby default + the bot `addBot`/`freshGame` seat) is simply
//     the highest-Elo version across all families. NO confidence gate — it just
//     follows the top of the ladder, so if two bots are within noise the label may
//     flip between them (they're genuinely ~equally hard, so the player loses
//     nothing).
//   - Each FAMILY'S BEST is the highest-Elo version within that family.
//   - DEPRECATED ⇔ no Elo (e.g. `claude-v1`, excluded from rating). Rendered
//     struck-through with "???" Elo and disabled in the selector.
//
// NOT here — and deliberately so: the evolution "CHAMPION/crown" and "SUBSTRATE"
// (which version we evolve the next bot from). Those are a DIFFERENT audience (us,
// the authoring loop) and a DIFFERENT bar (SPRT-confirmed, not a higher Elo point
// estimate), so they live in EVOLUTION.md + dev tooling, never in the player UI.
// The only hand-maintained data in this file is `FAMILY_SPECS` (display name +
// label prefix). See `bots/CLAUDE.md` "Lobby strength ratings".
