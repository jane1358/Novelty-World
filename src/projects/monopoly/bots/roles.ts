// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The lobby-selectable bot ROLES, expressed as data. Each role is a stable id
// (stored in `Player.botStrategy`) bound to a version POINTER. The seat-room UI
// renders one option per entry and `registry.ts` resolves each id to a policy,
// so adding a role, retargeting a champion, or registering a new version never
// touches the UI — only the relevant pointer below.
//
// Three orthogonal pointers, distinguished by WHO moves each:
//   - claude  (LIVE)  — the hand-picked shipped bot. A product call, lives in
//                       `bots/live.ts` → `LIVE_VERSION` (a deliberate, rare,
//                       human green-light; see EVOLUTION.md "Coexistence").
//   - champion        — the best version by measurement. Re-pointed here when
//                       the gauntlet crowns a new champion — the code half of
//                       the acceptance ritual (the other half is the
//                       EVOLUTION.md version-log row).
//   - latest          — the newest snapshot. DERIVED from `VERSIONS`, never
//                       hand-edited: registering a version makes it the latest.
//
// "Live pointer" semantics: a seat stores its ROLE (e.g. "champion"), not a
// frozen version label, so it always resolves to whatever the pointer names in
// the deployed code. Crowning/promoting a version retargets every seat using
// that role on the next deploy — including mid-game, which is intended (a
// champion seat should always play the current best).
