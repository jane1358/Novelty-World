// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The lobby-selectable bot ROLES, expressed as data and organized by LINEAGE
// (bot family — Claude, Jane, and any future Gemini/ChatGPT). Each role is a
// stable id (stored in `Player.botStrategy`) bound to a version POINTER; the
// seat-room UI renders one option per role and `registry.ts` resolves each id to
// a policy, so adding a lineage, retargeting a pointer, or registering a version
// never touches the UI — only the data here.
//
// The pointer scheme:
//   - champion          — the single STRONGEST version by measurement (highest
//                         gauntlet Elo) ACROSS ALL LINEAGES. Global, not per
//                         family: today a Claude version, tomorrow possibly a
//                         Jane or Gemini one. Re-pointed when the gauntlet crowns
//                         a new overall best (the code half of the acceptance
//                         ritual; the other half is the EVOLUTION.md log row).
//   - <lineage>         — that family's hand-picked / featured bot (`claude`,
//                         `jane`). For Claude this is the shipped LIVE pointer
//                         (`bots/live.ts` → LIVE_VERSION) — a human product call.
//   - <lineage>-latest  — that family's newest snapshot, DERIVED from VERSIONS by
//                         label prefix (never hand-edited: registering a version
//                         makes it that lineage's latest).
//
// "Live pointer" semantics: a seat stores its ROLE (e.g. "champion" / "jane"),
// not a frozen label, so it always resolves to whatever the pointer names in the
// deployed code; retargeting moves every seat using that role on the next deploy.

/** The strongest version by measurement (highest gauntlet Elo) ACROSS ALL
 *  LINEAGES. Bump when the loop crowns a new overall best — see EVOLUTION.md
 *  "Coexistence & promotion". (Jane's `jane-v1` only TIES this, so the overall
 *  champion stays a Claude version for now.)
 *
 *  WHY v35 IS CHAMPION DESPITE BEING A "WASH" (read before "fixing" this back):
 *  v35 is EVEN with v29 — confirmed on BOTH seed streams (train 50.6% / holdout
 *  50.7%, +4–5 Elo within noise, zero regressions) — NOT strictly better. Normally
 *  the crown moves only on a strictly-BETTER result, so by that rule it would stay
 *  v29. We moved it anyway, as a deliberate **quality tiebreak at parity**: v35
 *  removes the value-less denial hot-potato (the bot→bot ring a live game exposed —
 *  EVOLUTION.md Finding 2) that v29 still carries. At equal measured strength, the
 *  crown goes to the version WITHOUT the degenerate, player-visible behavior. This
 *  matters because the champion is the **base future versions branch from** AND the
 *  lobby "Champion" opponent — keeping it on v29 would propagate the bug into every
 *  descendant and let real players still see the ring. It's the v14 win-safe-
 *  correctness pattern, promoted to champion because the parity is confirmed on both
 *  streams and the displaced behavior is a genuine defect, not a style choice.
 *  (Elo is a tie, so this does not falsify "highest Elo" — it breaks the tie.) */

//
//   1. `types.ts` → add the family's two ids to `BOT_STRATEGIES`:
//        "gemini", "gemini-latest"          (the route validator picks them up
//                                            automatically — it reads this list)
//   2. `versions/` → add the snapshots under the family's label prefix, e.g.
//        `versions/gemini-v1/`, `versions/gemini-v2/`, … and register each in
//        `versions/index.ts` ("gemini-v1": geminiV1Bot, …).
//   3. Here → add one row to `LINEAGES` (and a featured-pointer const like
//        `JANE_FEATURED_VERSION` if it isn't the latest):
//        makeLineage({
//          id: "gemini",
//          latestId: "gemini-latest",
//          displayName: "Gemini",
//          versionPrefix: "gemini-v",   // namespaces its labels; derives `latest`
//          featured: GEMINI_FEATURED_VERSION,
//        }),
//   4. `registry.ts` → add the two keys to the `BOTS` literal (the exhaustive
//        `Record<BotStrategy, Bot>` will fail to compile until you do):
//        gemini: versionBot(lineageFor("gemini").featured),

// That's it — "Gemini" and "Gemini Latest" then appear in the lobby, compete in
// the gauntlet (`npm run sim:gauntlet -- gemini-v1 --base v29`), and are eligible
// for the single global `champion` pointer like any other family.
