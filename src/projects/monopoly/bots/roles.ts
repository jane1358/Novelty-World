// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The lobby-selectable bot ROLES, expressed as data and organized by LINEAGE
// (bot family — Claude, Jane, and any future Gemini/ChatGPT). Each role is a
// stable id (stored in `Player.botStrategy`) bound to a version POINTER; the
// seat-room UI renders one option per role and `registry.ts` resolves each id to
// a policy, so adding a lineage, retargeting a pointer, or registering a version
// never touches the UI — only the data here.
//
// The pointer scheme:
//   - champion          — the single STRONGEST version by measurement (highest
//                         gauntlet Elo) ACROSS ALL LINEAGES. Global, not per
//                         family: today a Claude version, tomorrow possibly a
//                         Jane or Gemini one. Re-pointed when the gauntlet crowns
//                         a new overall best (the code half of the acceptance
//                         ritual; the other half is the EVOLUTION.md log row).
//   - <lineage>         — that family's hand-picked / featured bot (`claude`,
//                         `jane`). For Claude this is the shipped LIVE pointer
//                         (`bots/live.ts` → LIVE_VERSION) — a human product call.
//   - <lineage>-latest  — that family's newest snapshot, DERIVED from VERSIONS by
//                         label prefix (never hand-edited: registering a version
//                         makes it that lineage's latest).
//
// "Live pointer" semantics: a seat stores its ROLE (e.g. "champion" / "jane"),
// not a frozen label, so it always resolves to whatever the pointer names in the
// deployed code; retargeting moves every seat using that role on the next deploy.

/** The strongest version by measurement (highest gauntlet Elo) ACROSS ALL
 *  LINEAGES. Bump when a new overall best is crowned — see EVOLUTION.md
 *  "Coexistence & promotion".
 *
 *  CHAMPION IS NOW A JANE-LINEAGE BOT (`jane-v2`) — the FIRST cross-lineage crown.
 *  jane-v2 is STRICTLY BETTER than the prior champion claude-v35, confirmed on BOTH
 *  seed streams with zero regressions: train 54.5% / +31.6 Elo, holdout 53.3% / +22.8
 *  Elo (gauntlet `jane-v2 --base claude-v35 --field claude-v35`, run on both `train`
 *  and `--prefix holdout`, 2026-06-21). Unlike claude-v35's promotion (a quality
 *  tiebreak at PARITY with claude-v29), this is a clean strictly-better result — it
 *  clears the normal
 *  "crown only on BETTER" bar outright, on both streams. jane-v2's own evolution
 *  journey lives in `versions/jane-v2/index.ts`; Jane is a separate lineage, so the
 *  Claude version log in EVOLUTION.md does not track it. `LIVE_VERSION` (the shipped
 *  `claude` bot) is unaffected — shipping is a Claude product call; only this
 *  cross-lineage measurement pointer moves. The next CLAUDE version still branches
 *  from the best Claude version (claude-v35), independent of this crown. */
