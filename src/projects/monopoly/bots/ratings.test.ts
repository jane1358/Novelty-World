// selector never shows a player a blank where an Elo should be — and so the
// auto-derived "best" pointers (overall + per family, in `roles.ts`) are always
// defined. A version is rateable unless it's `dumb` (a null stub) or in
// `RATING_EXCLUDED` (deliberately unrated — those render DEPRECATED). If this
// fails after you add a version, regenerate the ladder: `npm run sim:ratings`.
