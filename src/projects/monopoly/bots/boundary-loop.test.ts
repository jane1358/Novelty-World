// A pathological policy that exercises the boundary loop directly: it tries to
// (re)arm a trade at EVERY pre-roll, and the moment its trade intermission opens
// it cancels — the canonical arm -> open -> resolve -> re-arm cycle. Without the
// once-per-kind-per-turn-group boundary bound, this freezes the very first turn
// forever (the active player's pre-roll never reaches its roll). With the bound,
// the bot gets one trade window per turn-group and then the turn rolls on, so the
// game can never be stalled by it — at worst the bot is a bad player.
