/** Baseline bot policy: the decision a bot `playerId` should submit right now,
 *  or null if it isn't this bot's move. The store's auto-pacer iterates the bot
 *  seats and submits the first non-null intent; any connected client may proxy
 *  a bot (the route's version guard dedupes the redundant writes). A live
 *  human's own decisions are left to their UI — never to this policy.
 *
 *  Pure, same shape as the `Bot` interface sketched in `monopoly/CLAUDE.md`, so
 *  a smarter rule-based or learned policy can drop in later. Covers the
 *  proxy-driven decision phases:
 *  - `buy-decision`: buy whenever affordable, otherwise decline.
 *  - `auction`: while still in and not the standing leader, raise by
 *    `BID_INCREMENT` if the next bid stays within both the printed price and what
 *    cash covers, else drop. Bots never jam their own lead. v1 placeholder —
 *    TODO: net-worth bidding + real valuation.
 *  - `must-raise-cash`: if this bot is the current debtor (whoever is in the
 *    red, possibly out of turn after a trade), mortgage the cheapest
 *    un-mortgaged, building-free property — one per call until back to ≥ 0 —
 *    then, once nothing's left to mortgage, sell off a built set's buildings.
 *  - `trade-pending`: if this bot is an un-voted party, accept. v1 placeholder
 *    — permissive, no valuation. TODO: weigh the trade before accepting.
 *  - `jail-decision`: leave ASAP — a held Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card first (it's
 *    free), else pay the $50 fine when affordable, else `null` so the pacer
 *    issues the jail roll (gamble on doubles).
 *
 *  Mechanical phases (`pre-roll` → step, `post-roll` → end-turn) are handled by
 *  the pacer itself, not here. */
