// simulated game is a PURE, deterministic function of (seed, seating) — see
// `simulate.ts` — so games are embarrassingly parallel: distribute them across a
// pool of worker threads and the result is bit-identical regardless of which
// worker ran which game. This is what turns the ~30-min single-core gauntlet into
// a ~2-min run and makes SPRT's game volume practical. The main thread owns the
// stream of games to play and the SPRT/Elo aggregation; the workers only run the
// pure `simulateGame` and hand back a compact outcome.
