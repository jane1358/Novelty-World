// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Phase 1 of the learned-bot path (see monopoly/CLAUDE.md "Bots" and the design
// discussion): a PURE legal-action enumerator. `legalCandidates(state, playerId)`
// returns the moves that seat may legally make at the CURRENT decision point —
// the action half of a learned policy, the companion to `features.ts`.
//
// Why an enumerator and not a policy head that emits raw intents: Monopoly's
// action space is awkward for a learned model. The simple phases (buy / decline,
// bid, jail, accept-or-decline, the pre-roll arm) are a tiny discrete set, but
// trades and manage-builds are COMBINATORIAL (arbitrary property + cash
// reassignments). The hybrid design (see the discussion) sidesteps that: a model
// SCORES candidates rather than constructs them. With the pure engine you can go
// one step further — `applyCandidate` lets a value net do exact 1-ply lookahead
// (apply each candidate, evaluate the resulting state, pick the best), which is
// why the applier lives here next to the enumerator.
//
// What this covers, and the seam it leaves open:
//   - FULLY ENUMERATED (the bulk of real decisions): pre-roll arming, post-roll,
//     buy-decision, auction, jail-decision, trade-pending votes, and
//     must-raise-cash liquidation (one candidate per mortgageable lot). These are
//     immediately usable to train a value net via lookahead.
//   - CONSTRUCTED HERE: `managing` enumerates real build commits — develop each
//     owned (unmortgaged) monopoly evenly to every reachable level, as atomic
//     `manage` intents the engine validates (`planDevelopment`). This is the first
//     construction generator; it's deliberately bounded to even single-set builds
//     (the bulk of useful development) and is extensible (mortgage-funded builds,
//     unmortgage-and-redeploy, multi-set commits).
//   - TERMINAL-ONLY (still combinatorial): trade-building and raising-cash return
//     only their commit / cancel exits — constructing a trade draft / raise
//     staging is the next generator slice. A generator plugs in by producing the
//     `update-trade-draft` / `update-manage-staging` + commit sequence.
//
// Legality is the engine's, never ours: every enumerated intent is run through
// `isLegal` before it's returned, so a caller can apply any candidate without a
// rejection — the same guarantee the pacer relies on (`pacing.ts` `legalOp`). A
// seat that owes no decision right now gets `[]` (the "not me" case), mirroring a
// `Bot` returning `null`.
//
// Anti-loop guards (one proactive window per turn-group via `boundaryServed`,
// trade re-pitch memory) are POLICY, not legality, so they live in the driving
// policy/pacer — not in this pure legality enumerator. A learned policy that arms
// trades must apply them just as the rule-based bots do (see bots/CLAUDE.md
// "Trades").
