# Monopoly — Project Guide

This file is loaded into Claude's context for any work inside `src/projects/monopoly/`. Read it before touching code here.

## Philosophy: built for pros

This is Monopoly for players who know the game cold. They don't need explanations, animations, or confirmations — they need fast, dense access to the few decisions the game actually presents.

**The whole game collapses to a small set of real decisions:**
- Buy a landed-on property at face price, or send it to auction.
- During auction: when to bid, when to stop.
- Build / sell houses and hotels.
- Mortgage / unmortgage.
- Propose, accept, decline trades — what, with whom, how much.
- Jail: leave ASAP or stay. The long-term aim is a set-and-forget *stance*, not
  a per-turn prompt — but **v1 ships the per-turn prompt** (pay / card / roll
  each jail turn), a deliberate, owner-approved exception. The `jailStance`
  preference stays in the type, reserved for the future stance toggle. See the
  "Jail" section below.

**Everything else is mechanical and should run on its own:**
- Rolling dice, moving the token, passing GO, paying rent, paying tax, drawing and resolving Chance/Community Chest, going to jail on three doubles, busting at the end of a turn — none of this is a decision. The engine does it automatically.

**Auto-play is a spectrum, set by the player:**
- Default: pause only at real decision points.
- Threshold policies (later): "auto-buy until cash < $X", "stay in jail while late-game", etc. The engine should not preclude these; per-player preferences live in state.
- **Trades and property management happen at a turn boundary, not mid-turn.** A player arms "I want to trade" or "I want to manage" (the action-bar Trade / Manage toggles) at any time; the game pauses at the next **pre-roll** — the single point that is both "right after a turn ends" and "right before the next begins" — and opens that player's trade builder or manage intermission. Armed requests form one FIFO `boundaryQueue` (`{ playerId, kind: "trade" | "manage" }`), each resolved in turn before the roll. This is the official "act between turns" window for trading, building/selling, and mortgaging alike. See "Trades" and "Managing properties" below. (Supersedes an earlier mid-move-interrupt idea — the boundary model is simpler and deterministic. The earlier per-turn "armed pause" checkboxes are gone — arming a Trade/Manage queue slot now does that job.)

**UI consequence:** no "press to roll" button by default. No "you landed on Boardwalk, pay $50 rent — click to continue." The screen updates, the event log scrolls, the turn advances. Buttons exist only for actual decisions (and for arming a boundary action).

## Engine model: hybrid, state-authoritative

State is the single source of truth (one Supabase row per game). Events are folded into state as they happen; the log is derived, not authoritative.

**Two entry points to the engine — and only two:**

```ts
// External decisions only — humans, bots, future RL agent.
apply(state, intent, rng): { ok: true, state, newEvents } | { ok: false, reason }

// Mechanical transitions — runs until the next decision point.
autoStep(state, rng): { state, newEvents }
```

The authoritative route applies **one unit per call**: an `apply` for an external intent (no auto-drain), or a single `autoStep` per `step` request. Clients subscribe to the row and re-render as each unit lands. See the "Multiplayer / networking" section below.

### Intents vs mechanics — the line

**Intents (external API, small surface):**
- `buy` (optional `raise`: sell buildings / mortgage the buyer's OTHER lots to cover the price when cash is short — see "Buying short: the cash-raise" below), `decline-buy` (declining sends to auction)
- `bid`, `pass-bid` (during auction)
- `manage` (one atomic build/sell + mortgage/un-mortgage commit; see "Managing properties")
- `mortgage` (forced raise-cash only — the bot / `must-raise-cash` path; voluntary mortgaging goes through `manage`)
- `set-queue` (arm/disarm this player's `boundaryQueue` slot for `"trade"` or `"manage"` — carries the desired `armed` boolean so it replays idempotently through the optimistic overlay, not a relative toggle), `update-trade-draft` (proposer edits the live draft), `update-manage-staging` (actor edits the live manage staging), `cancel-trade`, `propose-trade`, `accept-trade`, `decline-trade`, `cancel-manage` (manager abandons their intermission) (`counter-trade` is a documented TODO, not wired)
- `pay-to-leave-jail`, `use-jail-card`
- `end-turn`

**Mechanics (internal to `autoStep`, never an intent):**
- Roll dice, move token, pass-GO credit
- Pay rent, pay tax
- Draw card, apply card effects (including recursive move + tile resolution)
- Go-to-jail (tile / card / three doubles)
- Detect bankruptcy, transfer assets to creditor or bank
- Detect winner

If something feels borderline (e.g. is "leave jail by paying $50" an intent or a mechanic?) — if the player could rationally choose either way, it's an intent. If the only "choice" is the obvious one, it's a mechanic gated by player preferences.

### State shape

Extend `GameState` with a `turn` block that captures **whose turn it is, what we're waiting on, and any in-flight sub-game** (auction, trade):

```ts
interface TurnState {
  playerId: string;
  phase:
    | "pre-roll"             // can roll or take pre-roll actions
    | "post-roll"            // moved + tile resolved; can build/end
    | "buy-decision"         // landed on unowned ownable; buy or auction
    | "must-raise-cash"      // someone is in the red; settle before continuing
    | "auction"              // auction in progress (see `auction` field)
    | "jail-decision"        // active player in jail, deciding pay/card/roll
    | "trade-building"       // a queued player is assembling a proposal
    | "trade-pending"        // a proposal is awaiting approval votes
    | "managing"             // a queued player's build/sell/mortgage intermission
    | "game-over";
  doublesStreak: number;     // 0-3
  pendingBuy?: number;       // position of property awaiting buy decision
  raiseCash?: "after-landing" | "pre-roll";  // where to resume after must-raise-cash
  auction?: AuctionState;
  managerId?: string;        // present during "managing" — the queued manager (may be off-turn)
  manageStaged?: ManageStaged;  // present during "managing"/"must-raise-cash" — the actor's synced staging
  tradeDraft?: TradeDraft;   // present during trade-building
  pendingTrade?: PendingTrade;  // present during trade-pending
}

interface GameState {
  ...existing fields,
  status: "lobby" | "active" | "finished";  // lifecycle (see "Lobby")
  turn: TurnState;
  boundaryQueue: readonly { playerId: string; kind: "trade" | "manage" }[];  // FIFO of armed between-turns actions
  preferences: Readonly<Record<string, PlayerPreferences>>;
  rngSeed: string;           // for deterministic replay + RL training
}
```

`autoStep` only progresses when `turn.phase === "pre-roll"`. It exits the moment it lands on a real decision phase. At a `pre-roll` it first drains `boundaryQueue` — opening a `trade-building` or `managing` phase for the head requester instead of rolling if anyone is queued.

### Debt — one path, may go negative (`must-raise-cash`)

Every charge a player can't cover from cash on hand resolves the same way, whether it's rent, a tax/fine, or the 10% mortgage interest from a trade:

- The charge is applied **immediately** — the debtor's cash can go **negative**.
- If `cash + raisable < 0` (raisable = mortgaging building-free properties; later also selling buildings at half), they can't recover → **bankruptcy** at charge time.
- Otherwise the engine parks in `must-raise-cash` and the **current debtor — whoever is below zero, in seat order (`firstNegativePlayer`), not necessarily the active player** — must mortgage back to ≥ 0. Multiple debtors (from a trade) settle one at a time. `turn.raiseCash` records where play resumes: `after-landing` (rent/tax — continue the active player's landing) or `pre-roll` (a trade — return to the boundary and re-check the queue).

This is why a trade can put an off-turn player into `must-raise-cash`: the UI (board-tap mortgage, mortgage panel) and the bot policy key the forced settler off `firstNegativePlayer`, not `turn.playerId`.

### Trades

Permissive by design: a **proposer (who need not be a party)** reassigns any **owned** (building-free) properties and held Get-Out-of-Jail-Free cards between any players, plus per-player **cash deltas that must net to zero** (money only moves between players; the bank is never a party). Shape is `TradeTerms` (`propertyTo` / `gojfTo` / `cashDelta`, storing only entries that change).

- **The draft lives in synced `GameState`** (`turn.tradeDraft`), edited via `update-trade-draft` snapshots, so **every player watches it take shape in real time** — the same broadcast discipline as a manage intermission's `turn.manageStaged`. The board rows are the property surface (tap to cycle the recipient); cash steppers + card rows live in the trade panel; the log is hidden while a trade is up to make room.
- `propose-trade` validates (moves something, ≥2 named parties, cash balances, and every resulting debtor could recover) and flips to `trade-pending` with an `approvals` map over the **named** parties (the proposer auto-approves iff named). **All approve → execute; any decline cancels.**
- **Mortgaged properties transfer still-mortgaged**, and the receiver owes the bank **10% interest** on each (official rule), charged through the `must-raise-cash` path above.
- **Counters are not built** — decline and re-propose. The `TradeTerms` model + `update-trade-draft` are shaped so a counter can be added later (see the `counter-trade` TODO on `Intent`).

### Managing properties (build / sell / mortgage)

A queued `manage` request opens a **`managing`** intermission at the pre-roll boundary for `turn.managerId` (who may be off-turn, exactly like a trade proposer). The actor stages changes into **synced `GameState`** (`turn.manageStaged`, seeded empty when the intermission opens), edited via `update-manage-staging` snapshots — so, like a trade draft, **every player watches the build/sell/mortgage take shape in real time**. They commit as **one atomic `manage` intent**, or abandon via `cancel-manage`; either returns to the active player's pre-roll (re-checking the queue) and **the phase transition drops the staging**.

- **One commit carries both** a `build` target (`position -> 0-5`, where 5 is a hotel) and `mortgage` flags (`position -> bool`). The engine applies it **raise-first / spend-second, all-or-nothing**, so a single commit can sell a property's houses *then* mortgage the bare lot, or mortgage one property to fund building another. It can never leave the board uneven or half-applied even if the bank shifted underneath.
- **The build planner is pure, in `development.ts`** (`planDevelopment`). It enforces the real rules: even-build across a color set, the full-unmortgaged-monopoly requirement, finite bank supply (**32 houses / 12 hotels**, derived from the board — no stored counter), the hotel-breaks-down-*through*-four-houses rule, and the official house-shortage **liquidation escape** (a hotel that can't be broken down evenly is sold straight to a bare lot). It returns an ordered, supply-safe step list + net cash, choosing the **cheapest** legal schedule (an exhaustive memoized search over color-group order; liquidation only when genuinely forced). Per-tier `build` / `sell-building` and `mortgage` / `unmortgage` events are emitted so the log replays the transaction.
- **`must-raise-cash` reuses the same commit core** (forced branch): the current debtor (`firstNegativePlayer`, possibly off-turn) raises by selling buildings and/or mortgaging — no builds, no un-mortgages — and `settleOrRaise` resumes play once they're back to ≥ 0. `maxRaisableCash` counts building sale value so a debtor with only built property settles instead of busting. `settleOrRaise` re-seeds `turn.manageStaged` empty on every entry, so a settled debtor's staged maps never leak into the next debtor's broadcast view.
- **The commit core is `applyManageCommit`** (raise-first / spend-second, all-or-nothing), shared by both `manage` branches **and the buy-decision cash-raise** (below). It carries no phase/turn concerns — the caller authorizes the actor and decides where play resumes. `isRaiseOnly(state)` (true for `must-raise-cash` *and* `buy-decision`) is the single predicate the client uses to gate the board to sell / mortgage only.
- **Board UI:** the manage panel uses the board rows as its surface — tapping a property's **color strip** cycles its build level (`square-row.tsx` splits the row into two tap zones), tapping the **row body** toggles its mortgage. The `ManagePanel` summary bar shows the combined net cash, the **remaining bank supply** (houses/hotels — surfaced only here), and a shortage-liquidation note when one is forced. Staging lives in synced state (`turn.manageStaged`); the store's `cycleBuild` / `toggleMortgage` send `update-manage-staging` snapshots through the optimistic `predict` path, and the pure preview math is in `manage.ts` (`manageSummary` = build plan with staged mortgages applied + the mortgage cash deltas). The panel is **shown to every player** (`prompt-section.tsx`, like the trade/auction panels) as a live view — only the actor gets the action buttons and interactive board zones. The **same panel serves `must-raise-cash`** (forced "Pay" mode: sell down / mortgage only), so a human debtor can sell buildings, not just mortgage. The log is hidden during `managing`, as for trades.
- **TODO (building auction — deferred to v2):** the official rule auctions scarce houses/hotels to the highest bidder when demand exceeds supply; v1 approximates with the arm-order FIFO. The agreed v2 design reuses the property-auction sub-game: a **batched build window** (collect all armed managers' commits at the boundary before executing builds) + **returns-first reconciliation** (apply every sell/hotel-upgrade that *adds* to the bank, then compare net house/hotel demand against supply) + the **single-unit auction run in a loop** over the contested tier. The key simplifier — players never contend for *placement* (a monopoly is single-owner, so even-build is independent per player), only for the shared integer house/hotel count — so contention is purely numeric and the auction unit is a fungible house. Collapses to today's FIFO whenever demand ≤ supply or there's ≤1 armed builder.

### Buying short: the cash-raise

The official rules let you mortgage / sell to raise the money for a property you've landed on but can't quite afford — as long as you raise it from assets you **already own** (no buying on credit). v1 supports this **without** a negative-cash detour or a new phase:

- The `buy` intent carries an optional **`raise`** (`ManageStaged`: build-downs + mortgage flips on the buyer's OTHER lots). `applyBuy` runs it through `applyManageCommit` (raise-only) **first**, against the buyer's pre-purchase holdings — which **exclude the landed-on lot, since ownership transfers only after the raise** — then gates `cash ≥ price` and buys. It's all one atomic apply: cash never goes negative, so `must-raise-cash` is never involved.
- **A lot can never fund its own purchase** — it isn't owned yet, so `applyManageCommit`'s ownership check rejects any raise entry for `pendingBuy`. This is the structural guarantee, not a special-case flag.
- **UI is the manage board surface, reused.** `manageActorId` returns the active player during `buy-decision`, so the color-strip-sells / row-body-mortgages tap zones light up for the buyer (gated to raise-only via `isRaiseOnly`). Staging lives in synced `turn.manageStaged` (seeded empty by `openBuyDecision`, dropped by `enterPostRoll` / `afterLanding` / `enterAuction`), so **every player watches the raise take shape**, exactly like a manage intermission. The `BuyPrompt` tracks cash → (after raise) → (after buy) and enables Buy once the projected balance covers the price; the store's `buyProperty` bakes the staged diff into the intent's `raise`. Declining drops the staging uncommitted (atomic with the buy that never happened).
- **The bot never raises to buy** — its policy buys only when `cash ≥ price`, else declines (the `raise` field is simply omitted). A smarter policy can opt in later.

### Auctions

One **shared sub-game** (`engine.ts`: `enterAuction` / `applyBid` / `applyPassBid` / `resolveAuction`), entered from two triggers and resuming via an `AuctionResume` continuation (the same pattern as `RaiseCashResume`):

- **Decline-buy** (`resume: { kind: "landing" }`): the active player declines a landed-on property (`applyDeclineBuy`). The auction resumes their landing through `afterLanding` / `settleOrRaise` when it ends.
- **Bank bankruptcy** (`resume: { kind: "bank-estate", debtorId, remaining }`): a player busts to the bank, and `goBankrupt` returns their buildings to the bank then auctions each bare lot. The lots resolve through `resumeEstate`, which auctions the next `remaining` lot, and when the estate is empty hands control onward. Skipped when the bust leaves a single survivor (game over) or the debtor owns nothing.

**Bidding is open-outcry — no turn order.** Any still-in player may `bid` at any time. A `bid` carries an **absolute `amount`** (the client sends what the bidder saw + one **+$10** increment). `applyBid` **always records** `bids[playerId] = amount` (capped at what they can pay), and the bid takes the lead only when `amount` tops the current `highBid` — an already-out-high bid still **counts** on that player's bar but leaves `leaderId` / `highBid` untouched. The standing `leaderId` **may bid again** to jam the price up; only thing they can't do is `pass-bid` (no retracting a winning bid). `AuctionState` holds `active` (still-in players, seat-ordered for display — membership is what matters, there's no rotation), `highBid`, `leaderId`, per-player `bids` (for the panel), and `resume`. The auction resolves (`auctionDecided`) once every non-leader has dropped — the **leader wins** — or everyone drops with no bid → **unsold, lot stays with the bank** (`auction` event with `winnerId: null`). Because drops are permanent the active set only shrinks, so it always terminates (the lone AFK-never-acts case is the same as any other phase — out of scope).

**Races are handled by the version-guarded CAS plus client-side REBASE — see "Optimistic reconcile" below.** Concurrent bids/drops are ordinary intents on the single authoritative row: one write wins; a stale write is a `conflict` that hands back the winning state, and the loser **rebases** its optimistic prediction onto it rather than dropping it. Bids/drops are fully **optimistic** (same `submit`→`predict`→pure-`apply` path as buy/trade), so a tap updates the panel instantly. The **absolute amount is what makes a bid safely rebaseable**: re-applying it onto the winning head just re-records the same number (idempotent), so a lost race never snaps the bar to zero and never auto-escalates the price — the bidder simply sees the new high and that their $X still stands on their bar.

**Bid caps = what you can pay** (`auctionBidCap`, enforced in `applyBid`):
- Decline-buy → **net worth** (`cash + maxRaisableCash`), the binding-bid rule. A winner who bids above cash drops into `must-raise-cash` (resume `after-landing`) and settles, possibly **off-turn** (the winner need not be the active player — exactly like the trade debtor path).
- Estate → **cash on hand** less the 10% interest on a still-mortgaged lot, so the winner pays immediately and never goes negative. **v1 simplification** (flagged): keeps the multi-lot loop free of nested settlement; a still-mortgaged estate lot transfers mortgaged and charges the receiver the official 10% interest (reusing the trade rule), an unsold one reverts clean.

**Player-to-player bankruptcy is now fully official** (no longer simplified): `goBankrupt`'s player-creditor branch sells the debtor's buildings back to the bank at **half price with that cash to the creditor**, transfers **bare lots** (mortgage status intact), and charges the creditor the **10% interest** on each inherited mortgaged lot — which can rarely tip an (off-turn) creditor into the red, so the rent path advances then `settleOrRaise(..., "pre-roll")`.

**Pacing / bots / UI:** `pacing.ts` `turnOp` lists `auction` among the off-turn decision phases, so any bot bidder is driven (no `driverRole` change). The bot policy bids `+$10` up to `min(printed price, cash)` then passes — a conservative v1 placeholder (TODO: net-worth bidding + real valuation). The **`AuctionPanel`** (`components/auction-panel.tsx`) is synced state shown to **everyone** (like a trade): it renders the lot, every player's standing (leading / bidding / in / out), and gates `Bid $<high+10>` / `Drop` on whether this client is the current bidder. `prompt-section.tsx` renders it before the `myPlayerId` gate; `footer.tsx` hides the log during `auction`. The `auction` event already renders in the log (winner + price, or "unsold").

### Jail

**Three ways in** — landing on the "Go to Jail" tile, rolling three consecutive doubles, and (deferred with the card system) drawing a "Go to Jail" card. All three relocate the player to the Jail cell, set `inJail` + `jailTurns: 1`, log `go-to-jail`, and **end the turn immediately** — going to jail forfeits the rest of the turn even if the move was a double, and never pays GO. `sendToJail` is the single entry helper.

**A jailed player's turn opens at `jail-decision`.** `autoStep` at `pre-roll` resolves the boundary queue first (so others' trade/manage arms still fire), then — if the active player is jailed — flips to `jail-decision` and stops. From there:

- **Human:** the prompt (`prompt-section.tsx` `JailPrompt`) offers **Pay $50 / Use card / Roll** each jail turn. Pay and card are intents; "Roll" fires the mechanical jail roll via the store's `step`. This per-turn prompt is the v1 exception to the "stance, not a prompt" philosophy (see Philosophy above).
- **Bot:** the policy leaves ASAP — **card → cash → roll**: spend a held Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card first (free), else pay the $50 fine if affordable, else return `null` so the pacer steps the jail roll. `turnOp` drives only a proxied seat here; a human's own jail turn waits for their UI.

**Four ways out:**
- **Roll a double** (`jailRoll`): leave and move out by the roll. Escaping on a double does **not** grant another roll (official) — `doublesStreak` stays 0, so the turn settles after the landing.
- **Pay $50** (`pay-to-leave-jail`, only when affordable) or **play a card** (`use-jail-card`, returns the card to the bottom of its deck): leave, then resume at `pre-roll` so the normal auto-roll moves them this turn — a double rolled *after* paying/carding *does* grant another roll (they're a free player again).
- **Serve the sentence:** a failed roll on jail turns 1–2 advances `jailTurns` and ends the turn; a failed **third** roll forces the $50 fine, then moves out.

**The $50 fine is a bank charge.** Voluntary pay is gated on cash ≥ $50 (no debt path). The forced third-turn fine routes through the unified debt model: `goBankrupt` is generalized to a **null (bank) creditor** — and a bank bust now **auctions the estate lot by lot** (see "Auctions"), with cards returning to their decks. v1 simplification flagged in code: if the forced fine alone pushes the player into the red, they settle (`must-raise-cash`) before the turn ends and the landing's *rent* is skipped for that rare case.

**All three jail entries are live**, including the card path: a "Go to Jail" card routes through `sendToJail(state, "card")`, and a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card is acquired by drawing the `jail-free` card (held in `jailFreeCards`, returned to its deck bottom when used). `jailStance` is reserved in the type for the future stance toggle. See "Chance / Community Chest decks" below.

### Chance / Community Chest decks

A card draw is **mechanical** — it runs inside `autoStep` via `resolveTile` when a player lands on a card tile, never as an intent. The 32 official cards (`CHANCE` / `COMMUNITY_CHEST` in `data.ts`) are modeled as a `CardEffect` union; the engine resolves each into machinery it already has, so **no card introduces a new decision phase**. Built for pros: a card is shown by its **shorthand `name`** ("Boardwalk", "Chairman", "Nearest RR"), not flavor text. The `card-drawn` event stores only `{ source, cardId, cash? }`; the log maps `cardId` → the shorthand.

- **Piles live in state.** `decks: { chance, communityChest }` are index lists into the static decks (front = next to draw), **seed-shuffled once at game start** (`initialDecks`, fed the injected RNG via the shared `shuffleArray`). A draw pops the front and rotates it to the bottom; a `jail-free` card instead **leaves the pile while held** (tracked in `jailFreeCards`) and is re-appended when used (`use-jail-card`) or when its holder busts to the bank (`goBankrupt`). Adding `decks` was a `GameState` field change → rows were wiped per the pre-launch rule.
- **Effects funnel into existing helpers.** `collect`/`pay`/`repairs` → a bank credit / `chargeToCreditor` (the same terminal-charge pattern as the tax tile, so debt routes through `must-raise-cash`). `pay-each` (Chairman) / `collect-each` (Birthday) → one `card-transfer` line per opponent through the debt model. `advance-to` / `back-three` → move, then **normal `resolveTile`** (so a card move onto a property charges normal rent, and Chance "back 3" from tile 36 chains a Community Chest draw). `go-to-jail` → `sendToJail`. `jail-free` → set the holder.
- **The only card-specific rent overrides** are the two "advance to nearest" cards: a railroad pays **2× the owner's normal rent**, a utility pays **10× a fresh dice throw** regardless of how many utilities the owner holds (`advanceNearestCard`).
- **Card movement that wraps GO** emits a standalone `pass-go` event for the $200 (the roll path encodes it inline on the `roll` event instead; cards have no roll).
- **Decisions a card can reach** are only the *existing* ones: an `advance`/`back` card that lands on an **unowned ownable opens the normal `buy-decision`** (buy or auction — this is the cards' "you may buy it from the Bank"), and any unaffordable charge drops into `must-raise-cash`. Both are pre-existing flows; the bot pacer and UI handle them unchanged.
- **v1 simplification (flagged in code):** a Chairman drawer who can't cover the full payout even after liquidating busts to the bank rather than paying each opponent as far as their cash stretches — vanishingly rare at $50/head. Birthday's opponent-can't-pay case is handled fully (they bust to the drawer).

### RNG: always injected, never `Math.random()`

Every randomness call goes through an injected RNG. Engine functions take an `rng` argument; the host advances it. This is non-negotiable — it's what makes deterministic replay, regression tests, and future headless RL training possible.

### Bot interface

```ts
type Bot = (state: GameState, playerId: string) => Intent;
```

The bot is given the full state (Monopoly is open-information) and returns one intent. The engine handles everything else. The same shape works for the dumb early bot, the rule-based bot, and an eventual learned policy.

The baseline lives in `bots/policy.ts` as `botIntent(state, playerId): Intent | null` — pure, returning the intent bot `playerId` should submit **right now**, or `null` if it isn't this bot's move. It covers the proxy-driven decision phases: `buy-decision` (buy when affordable), `must-raise-cash` (if this bot is the current debtor — `firstNegativePlayer`, possibly off-turn — mortgage the cheapest building-free property, then sell off a built set's buildings via `manage` once nothing's left to mortgage), and `trade-pending` (if this bot is an un-voted named party, **accept** — a permissive v1 placeholder; `TODO` real valuation). The store's auto-pacer **iterates the bot seats** for decision phases and submits the first non-null intent (a human's own decisions are left to their UI); the universal mechanical beats (`pre-roll` → step, `post-roll` → end-turn) run for whoever drives the active seat (`driver.ts`). **Bots never *initiate* trades** — nothing queues a bot, so the proposer is always human. Swap in a smarter policy here without touching the pacer.

## Lobby

A game row carries a `GameState.status` of `lobby` | `active` | `finished`. The lifecycle:

- `createLobby(host, rngSeed)` seeds a `lobby` row seating the host alone. Other clients `joinLobby` (auto-assigned the first free color + icon), `addBot`, `removePlayer`, and tweak seats via `setPlayerColor` / `setPlayerIcon` / `setPlayerName`. `startGame` validates the roster (≥2 players, ≥1 human) and flips `status` to `active`.
- These **lobby ops live in `lobby.ts` and are pure** (same discipline as the engine: no side effects, no `Math.random`/`Date.now` — the rng seed and any ids are injected or derived from the roster). Color/icon uniqueness is enforced on every seat and edit. They are wired through the authoritative route (the `join` … `start` actions in `protocol.ts`, applied version-guarded in `route.ts`) and surfaced by the seat-room UI (`components/seat-room.tsx`).
- The auto-pacer only runs while `status === "active"`, so a lobby (or a finished game) sits at rest. The immediate-play seed (`freshGame`, used by the local `dev` sandbox and the current online seed) skips the lobby and starts `active`; the engine flips `status` to `finished` when a winner is declared.

## Multiplayer / networking

**This project does not use the shared multiplayer stack.** Do **not** import from
`src/shared/lib/webrtc/` or `src/shared/lib/multiplayer/`, and do not use
`useLobbyRoom` / `useWorldRoom`. Those are peer-to-peer WebRTC meshes built for
real-time co-presence; Monopoly is turn-based and runs on a single authoritative
server row instead. (The shared **profile** helper, `@/shared/lib/profile`, is
fine — that's just local player identity, not networking.)

**There is no local/in-process mode.** Every game — including the `dev` sandbox —
runs on the authoritative route against a Supabase row. `dev` is just a reserved
game id that additionally accepts the debug actions (see "Dev sandbox" below);
it is otherwise a normal backend game.

**How networking actually works here — server-authoritative, one row per game:**

- **State is a single Supabase row** in `monopoly_games` holding the entire
  authoritative `GameState` plus an optimistic-concurrency `version`. Events
  live inline in `state.turns` (`TurnGroup[]`); the log is derived, not a
  separate table. Revisit if rows get fat over very long games.
- **The only writer is a Next.js Route Handler** — `src/app/api/monopoly/route.ts`
  — using the service-role client (`@/shared/lib/supabase/server-admin`). RLS
  locks the table to **read-only** for clients, so the route is structurally the
  sole writer. It runs the engine itself (`apply` / `autoStep`), so the stored
  state can never be set to anything illegal. The request/response contract is
  `protocol.ts`.
- **Clients never touch the DB directly.** They POST actions through
  `sync.ts:submitAction` — `create` (seed a lobby on first open), the lobby ops
  (`join` / `addBot` / `removePlayer` / `setColor` / `setIcon` / `setName` /
  `start`), the play ops (`submit` / `step`), and the dev-only `reset` — read
  the row via `loadGame`, list joinable games via `listGames`, and subscribe to
  changes via `subscribeGame` (Supabase Realtime postgres-changes on the anon
  key). Incoming state is folded in through the store's `applyStateUpdate`.
  There is **no client-to-client channel** — every message is an HTTPS call to
  the route plus the read-only subscription. The route shares one
  version-guarded write path (`mutate`) across every lobby and play op; only
  `create` (insert-only) and `reset` (upsert) seed without a version.
- **Writes are version-guarded** (optimistic CAS: `update … where version =
  fromVersion`). A stale write is rejected as a `conflict`; the route hands back
  the **winning state + version** so the client can rebase immediately (see
  "Optimistic reconcile" below) instead of waiting for the realtime echo. This is
  what makes it safe for more than one client to drive the same game at once:
  duplicate requests collapse to no-ops.

**Optimistic reconcile (client) — rebase, never drop.** A local UI intent is
applied to the display head instantly (`predict`) and queued in an `outbox`,
then flushed version-guarded. The invariant: **a local action is never silently
erased on conflict.** The optimistic overlay is a *replay* of the outbox on top
of the latest authoritative head (`reconcile.ts` `rebuildOverlay`), recomputed
whenever the head advances. On a conflict the client folds the winning state the
route returned and **replays the outbox onto it**, dropping only intents that no
longer apply: an armed `set-queue` re-arms onto the next boundary (the
Manage-flicker fix), an absolute `bid` re-records on the bidder's bar (the
auction snap-to-zero fix), a now-moot intent is pruned. There is **no per-intent
policy** — legality on the current head is the single arbiter, which is why
absolute bids matter (a relative bid would re-succeed on every replay and
auto-escalate). The pacer also won't drive a mechanical `step`/`end-turn` while a
local prediction is outstanding, so the auto-roll can't race the user's own arm.
A genuine rejection (illegal intent) still drops the overlay and surfaces a
`syncError`.
- **No server timer; the backend is delay-agnostic.** The route applies exactly
  **one unit of progress per call** — an intent `apply` (no auto-drain) or one
  `autoStep` per `step`. Pacing and animation are entirely client-side; the
  engine only advances when a client asks it to.
- **No host.** Every client POSTs actions to the route. The active player's own
  client drives its turn; **bot or disconnected-player turns are driven by any
  connected client** (the version guard dedupes the redundant writes). Whether a
  seat is a bot is read from `Player.isBot` in the state — no presence/online
  tracking. A turn belonging to a *disconnected human* simply waits until they
  return (AFK timers are out of scope).

**URL / routing** (`components/monopoly.tsx`): no `?game=` param shows the lobby
browser (`components/lobby-browser.tsx`); `?game=<id>` connects to that row —
while it's a `lobby` the seat room renders, once it's `active`/`finished` the
board does. `?game=dev` is the same path: it connects to the `dev` row (seeded
as an immediate-play game, so it lands on the board). The id is read from the
URL via `useSyncExternalStore` and changed with `history.pushState`, so browser
back/forward works. In the store, `gameId` is `null` while parked (the lobby
browser — the pacer is idle), or the row id (including `"dev"`) once connected.

**Dev sandbox.** The `dev` game accepts debug actions that no other game does:
the route only applies a `dev`-type action when `gameId === "dev"` (otherwise it
ignores it). The hotkeys (`dev.ts`) submit these like any move; the route runs
the pure transforms in `dev-ops.ts` (`restart` N-player, `own-all`,
`random-own` — randomness from `rngState`, never `Math.random`) and writes the
result, so they round-trip through the same version-guarded path + subscription.
`?game=dev`'s seed is `freshGame` (1 human + 3 bots, immediate play).

**Engine code (`engine.ts`, `logic.ts`) must be pure and free of React, side effects, and `Math.random`.** Components consume state via the store; they do not mutate it.

## Things to keep right

- **No legacy / back-fill handling (pre-launch).** The game is still in dev, so treat all stored data as disposable: a `GameState` may be assumed to match the *current* type exactly. Do **not** write migration shims, default-filling of newly added fields, or any code that tolerates an old row shape — when a field is added, wipe the rows instead (delete from `public.monopoly_games` via the psql one-liner in the root CLAUDE.md, then refresh). **Remove this allowance once the game goes live** — at that point real rows must be migrated, not deleted.
- **No hidden state in components.** All gameplay state lives in `store` or props derived from it. Local `useState` is fine for transient UI (open menus, hover) only.
- **Don't add buttons for non-decisions.** A button for "pay rent" or "continue" is a philosophy violation. If you're tempted to add one, the engine probably needs to take that step on its own.
- **The intent surface is small on purpose.** Resist growing it. New mechanics belong inside `autoStep`.
- **Events are derived.** Don't write code that synthesizes an event without the corresponding state change — that's how state and log drift apart.
- **Debug helpers stay in `dev.ts` / `dev-ops.ts`.** Never in the component. The hotkeys (`2`/`4`/`8` restart with N players, `0`/`1` ownership overrides, `n` new game) live in `dev.ts` behind a dev guard and submit `dev` actions; the pure state transforms live in `dev-ops.ts` and are applied server-side, gated to the `dev` game id.

## Testing

- `logic.test.ts` for pure helpers (`hasMonopoly`, `rentAt`, legality checks).
- `engine.test.ts` for `apply` and `autoStep` — feed a state + intent, assert the new state and event list. Use a seeded RNG. These tests are the regression net for the rules.
- E2E tests (Playwright) live in `e2e/`, exercise the multiplayer flow end-to-end, and assume the dev server on :3001.

When fixing a rule bug, add a failing engine test first — and **run it to prove it fails before writing the fix**. A test that was never seen red gives no confidence it exercises the bug. The bug + fix should be one PR.
