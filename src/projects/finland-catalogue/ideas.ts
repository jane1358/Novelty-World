    title: "Oodi – Helsinki Central Library",
    shortDescription:
      "A free, world-award-winning library opposite Parliament where the sweeping wooden architecture is as much the draw as the books.",
    longDescription: [
      "Oodi opened on Finland's 101st Independence Day in 2018 as Helsinki's flagship public library and the country's gift to itself for the centenary. Designed by ALA Architects (winners of an open international competition), it sits on Kansalaistori square directly across from Parliament — a deliberate civic statement that public knowledge belongs at the heart of the city. The exterior is a single sweeping curve clad in 33mm Finnish spruce planks that lifts at one end to form a sheltered canopy over the square.",
      "Inside, the three floors each have a distinct character. The ground floor is the loud, social one: a café, event stage, and Kino Regina cinema. The middle floor is for making — Urban Workshop with 3D printers, sewing machines, and laser cutters, plus bookable music studios, gaming rooms, and meeting spaces (all free). The top floor is the showpiece: a vast wave-ceilinged hall punctured by round skylights, called \"book heaven\" by locals, with the open stacks, a children's area, and a balcony that looks out over Parliament and the Helsinki rooftops. Robots ferry returned books up from the basement.",
      "Even if you don't open a single book, it's worth the half-hour visit just for the architecture and the view from the third-floor balcony. The IFLA named Oodi the world's best public library in 2019 and it remains one of the most visited buildings in Helsinki.",
      "Entry is free, no ticket needed — walk straight in. Combine it with Kiasma (modern art museum) and the Helsinki Music Centre next door, all within a five-minute radius. The café opens with the building, so it's also a perfectly good rainy-day work spot.",

    longDescription: [
      "Moomin World (Muumimaailma) opened in 1993 on the island of Kailo next to Naantali's old town, designed by Dennis Livson. It's a theme park in the loose European sense — no rollercoasters or thrill rides. Instead the island is built out as Tove Jansson's storybook world: a blueberry-coloured Moominhouse, the Hemulen's house, Snufkin's camp, the Hattifatteners' cave, Moominpappa's boat, and a small open-air theatre. Costumed Moomintroll, Snork Maiden, Little My, Snufkin, and the Groke wander the paths and pose for photos.",
      "The Moominhouse is the centrepiece — five storeys, every room dressed exactly like Jansson's pen drawings, and you can walk through the lot. The park is gentle and pre-school-paced; the appeal scales hard with how much your kids already love the Moomin books. Older children who don't know the stories may find it too sedate. The whole island is small enough to circle in four to five hours, and there's a sandy swimming spot if it's warm.",
      "It's strictly a summer attraction: the 2026 season runs 9 June – 21 August. Tickets are €43 per adult booked online (€45 at the gate); under-2s are free. From Helsinki, take a VR train to Turku (~2h), then Föli local bus 6 or 6A to Naantali (~30 min). It's a long day-trip — many visitors stay a night in Naantali or Turku. Combine with Naantali's wooden old town for a half-day on either side.",

    longDescription: [
      "Turku Castle (Turun linna) was begun around 1280 as a Swedish military stronghold guarding the mouth of the Aura River. Over the next four centuries it grew into a sprawling residence, peaking under Duke John of Finland and Catherine Jagellon in the mid-16th century, who added Renaissance halls, banqueting rooms, and a chapel. A 1614 fire gutted the upper floors; the castle was eventually restored over decades and reopened to the public in its current form in 1987. It's the most visited museum in Finland.",
      "Inside, the experience is genuinely castle-like — thick stone walls, narrow staircases, vaulted cellars, and a dozen rooms dressed to specific eras. The Renaissance section on the upper floors recreates the royal apartments with period furniture, tapestries, and costumes. The medieval bailey at the front contains the original 13th-century keep with its dungeons; the newer (16th-century) bailey holds the great halls. There's a chapel still occasionally used for services, plus rotating exhibitions on Turku city history.",

It was formed in 1999 by merging the Turku Maritime Museum and Åbo Akademi's older maritime collection. The indoor exhibition halls cover Finnish shipbuilding, life at sea, naval history, and the wartime navy — but the real draw is the fleet moored along the river: thirteen historic vessels including the full-rigged ship Suomen Joutsen, the wooden barque Sigyn (1887), the former steam cruiser MS Bore, gunboats, a minelayer, and motor torpedo boats.",
      "From May through September the ships are open and you can board most of them — climb below decks on Suomen Joutsen, walk the rigging gangways on Sigyn, see the cramped officers' quarters of a Cold War minelayer. Outside summer the ships are closed but the indoor exhibitions stay open year-round. Allow two to three hours in summer (longer if you really like ships); ninety minutes is enough in the off-season.",
      "Adults €12, children 5-12 €7, under-5 free; covered by the Museum Card. Open daily 11:00–19:00 in summer (May–Sept), Tue–Sun 10:00–18:00 the rest of the year.

After the war she became a stationary seamen's school in Turku, training nearly 4,000 cadets, and has been open as a museum since 1991.",

      "Helsinki Cathedral (Helsingin tuomiokirkko) is the Lutheran centrepiece of Senate Square, designed by Carl Ludvig Engel as part of his master plan for the city's neoclassical centre. Construction ran from 1830 to 1852 — Engel didn't live to see it finished, and his successor Ernst Lohrmann added the four small corner domes and the rooftop statues of the Twelve Apostles, cast in zinc in Berlin in the 1840s. Until Finnish independence in 1917 it was called St Nicholas's Church, named after the Russian tsar.",
      "The exterior is the icon — chalk-white, mounted on a tall flight of granite steps, with a single soaring green dome — and is the postcard image of Helsinki. The interior, by contrast, is famously plain: white walls, a modest organ, von Neff's altarpiece of the Deposition, and statues of Martin Luther, Philipp Melanchthon, and Mikael Agricola. The austerity is deliberate Lutheran taste; if you came for gilded icons or saints' chapels, you'll prefer Uspenski Cathedral on the harbour ridge five minutes away.",
      "Entry is free — there's a suggested donation (€5 winter, €8 summer) but no ticket. The cathedral is a working church, so services and concerts can close it to tourists; check the website if your visit is tight. Climb the steps even if you skip the interior — the view back down Senate Square is one of the great urban set-pieces in Northern Europe.",

The flanking streets are the city's flagship retail strip — Marimekko, Iittala, Stockmann, Kämp Galleria — and the south side has the historic Kappeli and Esplanade Chapel restaurants.",
      "There's nothing to book and nothing to pay for. Walk the length once to get oriented (it takes maybe ten minutes), grab an ice cream from the kiosk by the Swedish Theatre, and sit on a bench during a free concert. In winter the park is quieter but the trees get strung with lights, and the kiosks become glögg stops during the December market season.",

      "Kauppatori (Salutorget in Swedish) is Helsinki's main open-air market square, occupying the corner where Esplanadi meets the South Harbour. It has been a market spot since at least the 16th century — originally the muddy floor of a small bay where fishermen sold their catch, now a paved square anchored by Havis Amanda's fountain and ringed by the City Hall, Presidential Palace, and Swedish Embassy. The Suomenlinna ferries leave from the dock right beside it.",
      "Stalls open from spring through autumn under bright orange tarps, selling salmon soup (lohikeitto), fried vendace (muikku), Karelian pies, reindeer skewers, mustamakkara, and seasonal berries; alongside the food stands are fur hats, Lappi-themed knick-knacks, and Marimekko knock-offs (the real shop is up on Esplanadi). Late summer brings the herring market (Silakkamarkkinat), a tradition running since 1743 — fishing boats moor at the quay and sell straight from the deck. In December the square hosts the St Thomas Christmas Market.",
      "Open roughly Mon–Fri 6:30–18:00, Sat 6:30–16:00, Sun 10:00–17:00 in summer, with shorter winter hours. Free to walk through. Plan to grab lunch from a stall (€10–15 a bowl), eat at a tarp-table seat with a view of the boats, then walk straight up Unioninkatu to Senate Square or onto a Suomenlinna ferry. The official-looking gold-onion-domed building visible across the harbour is Uspenski Cathedral — five minutes' walk if you want to add it.",

It was renovated 2012–2014 and has been a deliberate go-to of the food-tourism circuit since.",
      "The 20-odd vendors lean traditional and local: salmon and Baltic herring from Eriksson's fish counter, reindeer cuts and lapland charcuterie at Salaska, Karelian pies at Story, cheeses at Hopia, and chocolate from Kultainen Hetki. About a third of the stalls are sit-down counters — Story does excellent salmon soup, Soppakeittiö across from it is famous for its rotating soup-of-the-day, and there's a small bar in the middle for a beer and oysters. Lunch is the right meal here; many stalls close at six.",

    longDescription: [
      "Suomenlinna (\"Castle of Finland\", originally Sveaborg under Swedish rule) was begun in 1748 to defend the eastern Baltic against Russia, designed by Augustin Ehrensvärd along Vauban-influenced principles. The fortress surrendered after a two-month siege in 1808, opening the door to Russia's annexation of Finland; the islands then served as a Russian naval base for a century, became Finnish in 1917, and were a military garrison until 1973. UNESCO listed the site in 1991. Around 800 people still live on the islands year-round.",
      "Six islands are connected by short bridges so you can walk the whole route on foot. The set-piece is Kustaanmiekka at the southern tip — a dramatic line of green ramparts, cannons, and the King's Gate facing open sea. On the way you pass the dry dock (still working — they restore wooden sailing ships there), Ehrensvärd's tomb in the central courtyard, the WWII-era submarine Vesikko (you can climb inside), the Suomenlinna Museum (orientation), the Toy Museum, and a brewery-restaurant. Allow at least three hours; six is closer to honest if you want the museums.",
      "The HSL public ferry leaves from Kauppatori roughly every 20 minutes in summer, every 40–60 in winter, and takes 15 minutes. A standard AB single ticket (€3.30, 90 min) covers it — the same ticket as a tram. The fortress itself is free and always open: museums charge €5–10 each (Museum Card OK), and most close in winter or run reduced hours. Year-round destination, but very different in character — summer is lush and full of picnickers; winter strips it down to icy ramparts and almost no one around.",
      "Bring layers and good shoes. The paths are gravel and uneven cobblestone. There's a café and the brewery on the islands but supplies are limited — most locals pack snacks and a thermos.",

      "Häme Castle (Hämeen linna) sits on the south shore of Lake Vanajavesi in the town of Hämeenlinna, halfway up the Helsinki–Tampere main line. Construction probably began in the late 13th or early 14th century as a Swedish administrative stronghold over the region of Häme; the surviving granite-and-red-brick walls date mostly to the 1320s onwards. Unlike Turku Castle (sea-facing, military-merchant) Häme is squarer, more compact, and more obviously medieval — a square keep with corner turrets, encircling curtain walls, and a moat.",
      "After Finland passed to Russia the castle was converted into a prison, and it served that role from the early 1800s until 1953. Restoration ran from the 1950s through 1979, when it reopened as a museum operated by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities. Inside, you walk through the King's Hall on the upper floor (with its restored painted-rib brick vaulting), period-furnished chambers, the chapel, and the prison-era cells in the lower courses. There are interpretive exhibits on medieval Häme and a few thematic events through the year — a Renaissance fair in summer, Christmas events in December.",
      "Adult ticket €15; family ticket (2 adults + 1–4 kids) €35. Museum Card OK. The combined ticket (€28) adds the Museo Militaria military museum and the old county prison, both on the same peninsula and worth pairing if you've made the train trip.",
