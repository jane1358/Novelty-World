//   1. "simple" — optimistic patch (sync, ~0ms). Only useful for single-node
//      edits; bulk changes (hydration) skip straight to "none" + worker.
//   2. "nice"   — heuristic worker pass (~tens of ms). First real layout the
//      user sees on cold load. Skipped after fancy has ever completed —
//      see `skipNice` below.
//   3. "fancy"  — optimal worker pass (seconds for large n). Replaces "nice".
//
// Once fancy has completed at least once, subsequent incremental edits skip
// the nice pass: the on-screen layout is already at fancy quality (a single
// optimistic tweak on top of a fancy result), and re-running the heuristic
// would visibly *downgrade* the layout for a beat before fancy catches up.
// The skip only applies when we kept the previous layout (currentKind ==
// "simple"); bulk replacements blank to "none" and still need the nice pass
// so the user isn't staring at an empty canvas while fancy grinds.
//
// The optimistic patch runs synchronously *during render* so the layout we
// return always matches the tree we were called with — otherwise a deletion
// would render once with a stale layout still containing the deleted node,
// and node lookups in the parent would crash. React's "deriving state from
// props" pattern: https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders
//
// Rapid edits terminate the in-flight worker (its remaining "fancy" pass
// would otherwise tie up the queue for seconds with a stale result).
