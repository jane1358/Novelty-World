// Phase breakdown bench: confirms HiGHS IP is still the dominant cost.

// Monkey-patches `highs.solve` to record cumulative MIP-solve wallclock,

// tree (refresh via the psql one-liner in trees.ts's productionTree() doc
// comment).
//
// Per-iteration timings go to console.log because vitest's `bench()`
// reports only aggregate ops/sec. iterations:3 keeps the run bounded and
// gives enough samples to spot run-to-run variance.
//
// Run with `npm run bench`.
