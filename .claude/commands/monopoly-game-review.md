Review a **real** Monopoly game (humans + bots) pulled live from the Supabase row,
and turn it into actionable lessons for the bot policies. The user described the
game to find as: **$ARGUMENTS**

The compiling is a script; the **analysis is yours**. Run every command from the
repo root.

## Steps

1. **Find the game.** List every stored game and match it against the description
   ($ARGUMENTS — player names, status, recency, or a literal game id):

       npm run game:review -- --list

   Each row shows the id, status, last-touched time, and the full roster with each
   seat tagged `(human)` or `[bot: <strategy>]`. Pick the one that fits. If the
   description is ambiguous (several plausible matches), ask the user which id
   before going further. If it names a specific id, skip straight to step 2.

2. **Compile the game.** Render the full play-by-play, standings, holdings, and
   money-flow tally:

       npm run game:review -- <id>

   Add `--quiet` for a decisions-only view (drops the dice/rent noise — the same
   filter `npm run sim --log` uses) when the full stream is too long to reason over.
   Read **both** if it helps: the money-flow footer (rent paid/received, builds,
   buys per seat) usually pinpoints where the game turned faster than the log does.

3. **Mind the version caveat — this is critical.** A seat's `[bot: <strategy>]`
   label is whatever it was *when the game was played*. Legacy pointers like
   `claude` / `jane-latest` predate the `claude-vN` / `jane-vN` namespacing and are
   **not** the current code — they may be several versions behind `HEAD`. Before
   blaming (or crediting) a behavior, check whether the current archive
   (`bots/versions/index.ts`, the top of the Elo ladder in `bots/ratings.ts`) still
   does it. State plainly in your write-up which bot version actually played and how
   far it is from current.

4. **Analyze for bot improvement.** This is the point. Ground every claim in the
   actual log, and frame fixes in the policy's own terms:
   - Read `src/projects/monopoly/bots/CLAUDE.md` (the strategic model: `positionValue`,
     the tuning constants, per-phase policy, trades) before proposing changes, so a
     suggestion lands as a constant/heuristic change, not a vague wish. Check the
     **"Considered and rejected"** and **"Refinement targets"** sections — your idea
     may already be tried (and washed) or explicitly declined, which is itself worth
     reporting.
   - Look for: monopolies left under-developed (the 3-house breakpoint), capital
     diffused across non-completing singles, over-leverage that forced selling an
     income engine, trades that handed a rival a set / a railroad, bad
     liquidation order, jail/auction misjudgments. The money-flow tally makes most
     of these jump out (e.g. a seat with `builds 0` never completed a set).
   - Separate **bot mistakes** (fixable in policy) from **variance** (dice). One
     game is n=1 — say so.

5. **Report.** Lead with the outcome (who won, finish order, humans-vs-bots), then
   the 2–4 highest-leverage lessons, each tied to a concrete spot in the log and a
   concrete policy lever. End with a recommendation: which lesson (if any) is worth
   pursuing as a `claude-vN+1` evolution — and note that a real refinement goes
   through the gauntlet + SPRT (`EVOLUTION.md`), not a hunch. **Do not edit any bot
   code from this command** — it is read-and-analyze only; propose, don't implement.
